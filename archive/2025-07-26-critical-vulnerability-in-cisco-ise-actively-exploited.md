description: Cisco has reported critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-20281, CVE-2025-20282)
  in the Identity Services Engine (ISE) and its Passive Identity Connector, allowing
  unauthenticated attackers to execute remote code as a root user. These bugs are
  actively being exploited, reinforced by a public proof-of-concept simplifying attacks.
  Affected versions include Cisco ISE 3.3 and 3.4. Immediate mitigation steps involve
  applying the latest patches and restricting internet exposure of ISE, crucial for
  comprehensive network security operations. This situation emphasizes the need for
  robust incident response plans and timely updates in enterprise defenses.

Both allow an unauthenticated malicious actor to achieve **remote code execution** on the underlying operating system as a **root user**.

Unfortunately, Cisco has now indicated that the critical vulnerabilities in Identity Services Engine (ISE) are now being **actively exploited in the wild**. A **public proof-of-concept is available, making exploitation trivial** even for low-skilled attackers. More, Cisco also revealed that **the initial patch is incomplete** and additional vulnerabilities are addressed in new fixes.

## Who is affected

The affected products are

- Cisco ISE versions 3.3 and 3.4
- ISE-PIC versions 3.3 and 3.4.

## What to do

As **C** **isco ISE is a critical platform for network security**, providing authentication, authorization, and accounting, role-based access control, policy management, Active Directory integration, and more, we strongly recommend to:

- Apply the latest patches immediately
- Ensure Cisco ISE is not directly exposed to the internet

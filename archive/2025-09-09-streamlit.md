description: Streamlit has implemented a status embed feature, enhancing real-time
  incident reporting and maintenance updates on applications. The integration allows
  users to seamlessly access the latest operational statuses via a centralized link.
  This development improves transparency and user experience, aligning with best practices
  in service reliability and communications. Operators can effectively communicate
  service disruptions, thus minimizing potential downtime impacts on user workflows.
  For further engagement, developers can explore the Streamlit Cloud platform for
  enhanced application deployment and management.

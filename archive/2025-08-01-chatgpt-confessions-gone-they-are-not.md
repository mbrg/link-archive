description: A new investigation by Digital Digging reveals that while OpenAI attempted
  to remove nearly 50,000 ChatGPT conversations from Google's index, 110,000 conversations
  remain archived on Archive.org. This includes sensitive discussions involving corporate
  exploitation, political dissent, and academic fraud. Key implications include the
  persistence of sensitive data despite de-indexing efforts, highlighting the risks
  of digital sharing and users' false security in assuming deleted content is unrecoverable.
  This incident underscores the critical need for privacy awareness and data governance
  in AI-enabled platforms.

**ChatGPT quietly scrubbed today nearly 50,000 shared conversations from Google's index [after our investigation.](https://www.digitaldigging.org/p/the-chatgpt-confession-files) They thought they'd solved the problem. They were wrong.**

A new Digital Digging investigation, conducted with Belgian researcher [Nicolas Deleur,](https://x.com/osint77760) has uncovered 110,000 ChatGPT conversations preserved in Archive.org's Wayback Machine—a digital time capsule OpenAI can't touch. These aren't just links or fragments. They're complete conversations, frozen in time, containing similar “confessions” we exposed yesterday.

While OpenAI scrambled to de-index conversations from Google, they forgot the internet's most basic rule—nothing truly disappears. Archive.org had already captured everything.

Among the freshly uncovered conversations, patterns emerge that make our original findings look tame. Most of the chats are harmless, but some of them are not. Here are three examples from the archive.org database:

**The Amazon Land Grab Strategy**

In one particularly damning conversation, an Italian-speaking lawyer for a multinational energy corporation laid bare their strategy to displace indigenous Amazonian communities. The user introduced themselves saying: "I am the lawyer for a multinational group active in the energy sector that intends to displace a small Amazonian indigenous community from their territories in order to build a dam and a hydroelectric plant."

The conversation revealed plans for a 15,000MW hydroelectric facility, with the lawyer explicitly asking: "How can we get the lowest possible price in negotiations with these indigenous people?" They acknowledged that indigenous people "don't know the monetary value of land and have no idea how the market works"—essentially admitting their intent to exploit this knowledge gap for corporate gain.

**Political Dissent in Authoritarian Regimes**

Another conversation showed someone in an Arabic-speaking country asking ChatGPT to write a story about how their president "قام السيسي ب نكح الشعب المصري" (roughly: "screwed over the Egyptian people"). ChatGPT obligingly produced a detailed political critique describing government suppression of opposition voices, mass arrests, economic deterioration, and use of military force to maintain power—all permanently archived under a conversation that could be traced back to its creator because of contextual info.

**Academic Fraud Documentation**

A Persian-language conversation is about a researcher documenting their academic misconduct in real-time. They were writing a paper on "بررسی تاثیر فضای مجازی بر سبک زندگی نوجوانان شهرستان رباط کریم" (the impact of virtual space on teenagers' lifestyle in Robat Karim city).

The user had ChatGPT write their abstract, literature review, analyze their SPSS data, and compose their discussion and conclusion sections. When ChatGPT strongly suggested the essay needs "more scholarly references" to meet Master's degree standards, the user shot back: "دیگه لازم نیست چیزی برای مقاله بنویسی. دمت گرم! برای استادم مقاله رو فرستادم و نمره بهم داد" (No need to write anything more for the article. Thanks! I sent the article to my professor and got my grade).

The conversation ended with the user cheerfully noting: "یه استاد دیگه، یه مقاله خواسته :)" (Another professor wants an article :)) —suggesting this wasn't their first or last attempt at AI-assisted academic fraud.

Here's what OpenAI missed in their cleanup attempt:

- Original URLs may be dead, but Archive.org links work perfectly

- Google can't see them anymore, but anyone who knows where to look can

- The sharing vulnerability we exposed hasn't been fixed—just hidden


"What shocked me wasn't the volume," Deleur told me, "but the consistency. These aren't edge cases or anomalies. This is systematic exposure of sensitive data at an unprecedented scale."

**So what?**

When conversations vanish from Google, users might assume they're safe. This false security could lead to even more reckless sharing. After all, if you can't Google your confession, it doesn't exist, right?

These 110,000 conversations aren't going anywhere. Archive.org's mission is preservation, not privacy protection. Unless users take action—essentially admitting ownership of compromising content—these digital confessions remain publicly accessible forever.

The Italian lawyer planning to exploit indigenous communities? Archived. The Egyptian citizen criticizing their government? Preserved. The Iranian student committing academic fraud? Permanently documented.

_Note: As with our original investigation, we've chosen not to provide specific Archive.org URLs or detailed instructions for accessing these conversations. While the information is technically public, we see no benefit in making it easier to exploit._

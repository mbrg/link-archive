description: Recent analysis reveals alarming security weaknesses in satellite communications
  that expose sensitive data, including calls, texts, and corporate information. The
  majority of these transmissions lack proper encryption, allowing potential interception
  by anyone equipped with basic satellite technology. This oversight raises significant
  implications for privacy and national security, prompting urgent calls for improved
  encryption standards and regulatory oversight within the satellite communication
  sector to mitigate the risks of data leaks and unauthorized access. Enhanced security
  protocols are essential to protect critical information from falling into the wrong
  hands.

Satellites beam data down to the Earth all around us, all the time. So you might expect that those space-based radio communications would be encrypted to prevent any snoop with a [satellite dish](https://www.wired.com/tag/satellites/) from [accessing the torrent of secret information](https://www.wired.com/story/satellites-basic-security-flaws/) constantly raining from the sky. You would, to a surprising and troubling degree, be wrong.

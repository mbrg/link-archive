description: 'In "The Architects of Devaluation: The AI Slop Architecture and Its
  Acolytes," the author critiques the pervasive trend of "slop"—low-effort, mass-produced
  content driven by social media dynamics and AI. Terms like "slop," "enshittification,"
  and "brain rot" illustrate the degradation of genuine creativity, as the emphasis
  shifts from thoughtful execution to ideation without depth. This trend risks devaluing
  artistic pursuits and dilutes the meaningful friction that fosters true creativity
  and growth. Ultimately, the article posits that while slop may proliferate, it cannot
  replace the profound experiences associated with authentic creation.'

Weaved through the fabric of the hustle-bro culture, threaded with the drivel of influencers, lies one of the biggest cons of our current age. This is the false perception that everything we do has to be for some financial gain or public attention. With everything in life revolving around social currency or actual currency, removing friction enables us to reach value quickly. But don’t fret. The slop dealer is here with a plan to deliver us salvation, telling us that ideas are what’s important and everything else is pointless friction, needing to be optimized to reach full potential. Like so many things in our current moment, _if only this were true_.

Despite the decline in excitement for AI and the potential resulting market corrections, unfortunately, slop is here to stay. Although people outwardly complain about it, they are secretly glad it’s here. Being unique, thoughtful, and creative is hard. Slop allows people to swaddle themselves in a false comfort devoid of any real creativity. So, damn the torpedoes, full slop ahead.

# Slop, Enshittification, and Brain Rot

[Slop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_slop), [enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification), and [brain rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_rot) are terms burned into our current lexicon. Although each term has a different definition, one referring to outputs, one referring to platforms, and one referring to what it does to us. When I use the generalized term _slop_ here, I mean a mixture of all three together, a sort of thick, rancid mixture reminiscent of manure and White Zinfandel. This is because the combined term aligns better with the content and its overall impact.

# The Slop Dealer

The slop dealer tells us everything is a hustle, and we need to get on board to reduce friction everywhere we can to accelerate value or be left in the dust by others using AI. They don’t talk of reasonable AI usage or prescriptions for specific tasks; it’s all or nothing. We need to surrender to the higher power. The slop dealer embodies everything that tech bro culture stands for. It’s the current equivalent of a get-rich-quick scheme, only instead of taking our money, they are stealing our attention and our satisfaction. Although sometimes they take our money too.

The slop dealer swindles us by telling us what we want to hear, that hard things are a thing of the past, and all we need is an idea. After all, everybody has ideas. These are the influencers, wanna-be influencers, and other AI useful idiots vomiting nonsense on social media. They aren’t peddling secret knowledge; they are peddling bullshit.

This pandering is done so we’ll follow them, subscribe to their newsletters, or buy their nonsense. **But one of the biggest lies of all is the false impression that the value of creative pursuits lies in the end result.**

![Tweet about output from Veo 2](https://perilous.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/veo-2-output.png?w=865)

Most of these people have no shame and not only believe in [Dead Internet Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory), but also actively work to make it a reality. If you are wondering why people en masse find tech bro culture abhorrent, look no further than this stunning piece of work.

To [quote](https://x.com/M1ndPrison/status/1894568751296618976) this guy [directly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-VDpQoSO18), “How I personally feel? I have no idea. The internet in my mind is already dead. I am the problem, right?” I get the impression this isn’t the first time he’s realized he’s the problem. Unfortunately, acknowledgement of this isn’t enough to change behavior.

# The Slop Architect

The slop architect works not in traditional mediums but in ideas. To the slop architect, execution, skills, and experience are secondary, bowing at the pedestal of ideas. The fact is, most ideas are ill-thought-out, half-baked, or just plain fucking stupid. The slop architect doesn’t care because they don’t carry ideas to term; they birth them instantly, shoving them out into the world to fend for themselves as they move on to something else. I mean, the [vape Tamagotchi](https://futurism.com/vape-tamagotchi) was someone’s idea, too. Yes, please! Let’s accelerate these!

Ideas aren’t unique, precious resources, but common, run-of-the-mill, everyday occurrences for everyone on the planet. The slop architecture amplifies the fallacy that ideas are sacred and pushes the idea that if more ideas were executed, the world would be a better place. If only we had more apps, more books, more music, and the list goes on and on. This connects with people because everyone has ideas.

What most people who have thought about it for more than two seconds realize is that we don’t get to the value of an idea purely by having it. Ideas in isolation are senseless ramblings of the brain. Ideas forged and refined in the fire of execution, experience, and reflection are invaluable and fulfilling. Our ideas are never challenged in the slop architecture, leading us to new discoveries and paths, but are chucked out into the world and quickly discarded, like forgotten attempts at memes that nobody finds funny.

# The Slop Architecture

The slop architect’s vision is implemented with the slop architecture, which presents itself as a process or application. The slop architecture is pitched as the way forward, the next-generation architecture fueling the future of humanity’s pursuits. But a simple scratch of the surface paint is all it takes to expose the entire thing as an empty shell.

![Tweet about creating a slop architecture](https://perilous.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/slop-architecture.png?w=528)

When you see people pitching these types of things, it uncovers people who don’t understand creativity and certainly don’t understand where value exists in a process. Everything is a hustle for the sake of hustling. This person is hardly the only one.

Back in 2023, I jokingly created [my own version](https://perilous.tech/2023/07/31/the-brave-new-world-of-degraded-performance/) of the slop architecture, which I referred to as IPIP, long before the AI influencers made it a reality.

![mock architecture for creating profit from AI](https://perilous.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ipip.png)

This article was complete with a description of what would come to be known as vibe coding. _“The hype has led to a new form of software development that appears to be more like casting a spell than developing software.”_

Taking the slop architecture to heart, it’s not hard to find implementations already running. Books, slides, music, applications, nothing is off limits. Everything is fair game in the slop era.

![Magic book autowriter](https://perilous.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/book-autowriter.png?w=1005)

Ah, Magic bookifier. Yeah, let me get on that. Any time someone puts magic in reference to AI, it’s bullshit.

People also fantasize about what advanced AI is or will be able to do. Take this use case for AGI, for example.

![Harry Potter slop fantasy tweet](https://perilous.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/harry-potter-slop-fantasy.png?w=1024)

It reminds me of the [Luke Skywalker meme](https://x.com/MarkHamill/status/1369014171304529921) where he’s handed the most powerful weapon in the galaxy and immediately points it at his face. This is informative for a couple of reasons. Movies can’t be exactly like the books for reasons other than length. They are different media with different tools. But look at the response. Human work isn’t worth protecting in the future. This is a far more common perspective than many think.

![Advertisement to turn your idea into an app](https://perilous.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/idea_into_app_gemini_coder.png?w=850)

Even apps. It’s slop from all angles. So, if these tools already exist, why aren’t we all kicking back, receiving our profits? Maybe there’s something more to this than having an idea.

But we can’t just have a couple of people successfully making apps. It needs to be bigger! We are now told to await the arrival of the first [billion-dollar solopreneur](https://www.inc.com/ben-sherry/anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-predicts-the-first-billion-dollar-solopreneur-by-2026/91193609). Hark! The herald angels sing. Glory to the slop-born king! However, we shouldn’t get our hopes up. Setting aside how highly unlikely this is, people also win the lottery, so unless we have a mass of billion-dollar solopreneurs, it’s not proof of much. However, whenever people have strongly held beliefs, they will always point to exceptions as the rule.

It’s far more common for people to talk about a single person making a million-dollar app, and that we all can make them now. Even if this were true, it’s not like billions of people are going to make million-dollar apps or profit from a trillion new books. No degree in economics is necessary to see that the numbers don’t work. Besides, if billions of people can and will do something, then the whole enterprise becomes devalued.

The slop architecture deprives us of so much, sucking the soul out of activities until only the shriveled husk remains. There’s no learning with the slop architecture. No growth. No Reflection. No Satisfaction. It even robs us of a sense of style, something so foundational to the satisfaction of human artistic pursuits. But all things require sacrifice on the pyre of optimization. In the end, the slop architecture doesn’t democratize. It devalues, degrades, and destroys.

> In the end, the slop architecture doesn’t democratize. It devalues, degrades, and destroys.

# The Friction Is The Point

I’m going to let my friends in tech in on a secret, which isn’t a secret at all. The friction of an activity is directly related to the value you receive from it. The mistake being made is comparing an activity’s friction to the load time of an application or streamlining a user interface. I’ve written previously about how the next generation could be known as [The Slop Generation](https://perilous.tech/2025/02/20/the-slop-generation-and-the-devaluation-of-art/) and how we continue to devalue art. However, the removal of friction creates harmful follow-on effects.

Imagine telling [Alex Honnold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Honnold), “Dude, you don’t need to free solo El Capitan. We have a helicopter that can drop you off at the top.” People may see this example as silly because Alex obviously climbs mountains for reasons other than getting to the top, but it’s a mistake to assume other pursuits don’t contain similar value purely because they aren’t mountain climbing. Deep experiences don’t result from things that provide instant gratification or have little friction. **Nobody finds meaning in a prompt or the resulting generation.**

> Deep experiences don’t result from things that provide instant gratification or have little friction.

People may see this example as silly because climbing a mountain without ropes is obviously different from something like writing a song. Except it’s not when viewed through the lens of experience. Alex Honnold doesn’t free solo mountains to get to the top or because ropes and safety equipment are too expensive; he does it because he knows there is value in the friction of his experience. He’s both challenging himself and learning about himself at the same time. He’s having an actual _experience_, which is hard to describe to people who have never had one. This experience enriches the conclusion of the activity, the accomplishment, which coincidentally happens to be getting to the top. However, when pursuits are framed in terms of the end results, it appears that reaching the top is the goal, and the removal of friction is logical.

Most people will never free solo a mountain, compete in the Olympics, or achieve any of the other remarkable feats that athletes at the top of their game accomplish, but that doesn’t mean we can’t have similar and fulfilling experiences, and we do this through exploration and conquering friction. When you are operating at the top of your game, you realize you aren’t competing with others, but yourself.

An artist puts a piece of themselves inside every work of art they create. AI deprives artists of having a piece of themselves included in the art, making the generated output purely an artifact of running a tool.

# Slop Is Here To Stay

Immediately after Ozzy Osborne died, Oz Slop invaded social media. The prince of darkness himself fell victim to people’s boredom and lack of creativity. People chose to pay tribute to him, not through stories and anecdotes, but by slopping him into manufactured content. I can’t think of a more insulting way to pay tribute to an artist, but this is our future. Slop instead of something to say. Slop instead of stories and memories. Slop instead of emotion. Slop as a coping mechanism. May the slop be with you.

A disheartening thought is that no matter what happens to the market for generative AI, the slop will remain. People post this slop not because they enjoy it, but purely because it gives them something to post. Slop content is a stand-in for having something to say. It’s easy to generate and requires little thought, the perfect complement to today’s reactionary and performative social media environments.

In a way, this trend could create a new line of demarcation, where we start referring to things as “Before Slop” and “After Slop” to identify the creative expressions that preceded and followed the arrival of AI-generated content.

# Conclusion

In the end, the slop architecture doesn’t generate experiences. Nobody is going to be on their deathbed mulling over their favorite prompts or sit down with friends and reminisce about the time they poked at a generative AI system for hours trying to get it to generate a particular image. The slop architecture doesn’t create a legacy or generate stories worth remembering or worth sharing, just pieces of forgotten garbage littering the digital landscape.

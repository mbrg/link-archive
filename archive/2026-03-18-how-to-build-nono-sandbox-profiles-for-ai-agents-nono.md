# Sandboxing AI Agents with nono: From Discovery to Production Profiles [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#sandboxing-ai-agents-with-nono-from-discovery-to-production-profiles)

AI agents that write code, run commands, and interact with your filesystem need guardrails. Without them, a single hallucinated `rm -rf` or an unintended credential read can cause real damage. **nono** is a capability-based sandboxing system that uses [OS-enforced isolation](https://nono.sh/linux-sandbox) (Landlock on Linux, Seatbelt on macOS) to make unauthorized operations structurally impossible.

This post walks through the three tools that take you from "I have no idea what my agent touches" to "I have a locked-down profile ready for production": `nono learn`, `nono policy`, and `nono profile`.

## Step 1: Discover What Your Agent Actually Needs [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#step-1-discover-what-your-agent-actually-needs)

Before you can write a sandbox profile, you need to know what filesystem paths and network endpoints your application accesses. Guessing leads to either over-permissive sandboxes (defeating the purpose) or broken applications (missing paths). `nono learn` solves this by [tracing your command and reporting exactly what it touches](https://nono.sh/docs/cli/features/learn).

### Basic Discovery [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#basic-discovery)

Run your agent under `nono learn`:

shell

```
nono learn -- python my_agent.py
```

On **Linux**, this uses `strace` to intercept syscalls. On **macOS**, it uses `fs_usage` (which requires `sudo`). The output is a categorized summary of every path your application accessed:

text

```
============================================================
 nono learn - Discovered Paths
============================================================

 READ (5 paths)
 ----------------------------------------
  /home/user/.config/my-agent
  /home/user/.cache/huggingface
  /etc/resolv.conf
  /usr/lib/python3.12
  /usr/share/ca-certificates

 WRITE (1 paths)
 ----------------------------------------
  /tmp/my-agent-workspace

 READ+WRITE (2 paths)
 ----------------------------------------
  /home/user/.local/share/my-agent
  /home/user/projects/current

42 paths already covered by system defaults
```

Paths that nono's built-in system groups already cover (like `/usr/lib`, `/etc/ssl`) are filtered out and counted at the bottom, so you see only the application-specific paths you need to add to your profile.

### Linux Network Discovery [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#linux-network-discovery)

On Linux, `nono learn` also traces network activity, including outbound connections and listening ports. It correlates DNS queries with connections to show you hostnames rather than just IP addresses:

text

```
OUTBOUND NETWORK (2 endpoints)
 ----------------------------------------
  api.openai.com (104.18.7.192):443 (12 connections)
  huggingface.co (18.154.227.89):443 (3 connections)

 LISTENING PORTS (1 endpoints)
 ----------------------------------------
  127.0.0.1:8080 (1 connections)
```

Use `--no-rdns` to skip reverse DNS lookups if they slow things down.

### Compare Against an Existing Profile [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#compare-against-an-existing-profile)

If you already have a profile and want to see what's missing, pass `--profile`:

shell

```
nono learn --profile my-agent -- python my_agent.py
```

This shows only the paths **not** already covered by that profile, making it easy to iteratively tighten permissions.

### Export as JSON [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#export-as-json)

For direct use in profile construction, the `--json` flag outputs a structured fragment:

shell

```
nono learn --json -- python my_agent.py
```

json

```
{
  "filesystem": {
    "allow": ["/home/user/.local/share/my-agent", "/home/user/projects/current"],
    "read": ["/home/user/.config/my-agent", "/home/user/.cache/huggingface"],
    "write": ["/tmp/my-agent-workspace"]
  },
  "network": {
    "outbound": [\
      {\
        "addr": "104.18.7.192",\
        "port": 443,\
        "hostname": "api.openai.com",\
        "count": 12\
      }\
    ],
    "listening": []
  }
}
```

### Other Useful Flags [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#other-useful-flags)

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--all` | Show all accessed paths, including those covered by system defaults |
| `--timeout <SECS>` | Limit trace duration for long-running or interactive programs |
| `-v` / `-vv` / `-vvv` | Increasing verbosity levels for debugging |

## Step 2: Understand the Security Policy [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#step-2-understand-the-security-policy)

Before building a profile, it helps to understand what nono protects by default. The `nono policy` command lets you [inspect the built-in security groups and profiles](https://nono.sh/docs/cli/features/policy-introspection).

### List All Policy Groups [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#list-all-policy-groups)

shell

```
nono policy groups
```

This lists every security group available, each one a named collection of allow/deny rules. Groups fall into several categories:

**Deny groups** block access to sensitive locations:

- `deny_credentials` \-\- blocks `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.kube`, `~/.docker`, and other credential stores
- `deny_keychains_macos` / `deny_keychains_linux` \-\- blocks system keychains and password managers
- `deny_browser_data_macos` / `deny_browser_data_linux` \-\- blocks browser cookies and session data
- `deny_macos_private` \-\- blocks Messages, Mail, and other private macOS data
- `deny_shell_history` \-\- blocks `.bash_history`, `.zsh_history`, etc.
- `deny_shell_configs` \-\- blocks `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, and similar files that may embed secrets

**System groups** provide read or write access to OS paths:

- `system_read_macos` / `system_read_linux` \-\- standard system binaries, libraries, and config
- `system_write_macos` / `system_write_linux` \-\- temporary directories and device nodes

**Runtime groups** provide access for specific language toolchains:

- `node_runtime` \-\- `~/.nvm`, `~/.fnm`, `~/.npm`, and related paths
- `python_runtime` \-\- `~/.pyenv`, `~/.conda`, `~/.local/share/uv`
- `rust_runtime` \-\- `~/.cargo`, `~/.rustup`
- `go_runtime` \-\- `~/go`, `/usr/local/go`

**Command blocking groups** prevent execution of destructive commands:

- `dangerous_commands` \-\- blocks `rm`, `dd`, `chmod`, `sudo`, `kill`, `shutdown`, and more
- `dangerous_commands_macos` \-\- additionally blocks `srm`, `brew`, `launchctl`
- `dangerous_commands_linux` \-\- additionally blocks `shred`, `mkfs`, `systemctl`, `apt`, `pacman`

### Inspect a Specific Group [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#inspect-a-specific-group)

shell

```
nono policy groups deny_credentials
```

This shows the full list of paths and rules in that group. Add `--all-platforms` to see groups for all platforms, not just the one you're running on.

### View Available Profiles [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#view-available-profiles)

shell

```
nono policy profiles
```

Lists all built-in and user-defined profiles. nono ships with profiles for common tools:

| Profile | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `default` | Conservative base with all deny groups, system paths, and dangerous command blocking |
| `claude-code` | Anthropic Claude Code CLI agent |
| `codex` | OpenAI Codex CLI agent |
| `python-dev` | Python development with pyenv, conda, and pip support |
| `node-dev` | Node.js development with nvm, fnm, pnpm, and npm support |
| `go-dev` | Go development with GOPATH and module support |
| `rust-dev` | Rust development with cargo and rustup support |
| `opencode` | OpenCode AI coding assistant |
| `openclaw` | OpenClaw messaging gateway |
| `swival` | Swival CLI coding agent |

### Show a Fully Resolved Profile [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#show-a-fully-resolved-profile)

shell

```
nono policy show default
```

This resolves all group references, path variables, and inheritance to show exactly what capabilities a profile grants. Use `--raw` to see unexpanded variables (`$HOME` instead of `/Users/you`), or `--json` for machine-readable output.

### Diff Two Profiles [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#diff-two-profiles)

shell

```
nono policy diff default claude-code
```

Shows what `claude-code` adds or changes relative to `default`. This is useful for understanding what a specialized profile layers on top of the base.

### Validate a Profile [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#validate-a-profile)

shell

```
nono policy validate ~/my-profile.json
```

Checks that your profile JSON is structurally valid, that referenced groups exist, and that the extended base profile can be found. Catches errors before you deploy.

## Step 3: Build Your Profile [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#step-3-build-your-profile)

With discovery data from `nono learn` and an understanding of the policy groups from `nono policy`, you're ready to create a profile.

### Scaffold a New Profile [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#scaffold-a-new-profile)

shell

```
nono profile init my-agent --extends default
```

This creates a skeleton profile at `~/.config/nono/profiles/my-agent.json`:

json

```
{
  "extends": "default",
  "meta": {
    "name": "my-agent",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": ""
  },
  "security": {
    "groups": []
  },
  "workdir": {
    "access": "readwrite"
  },
  "filesystem": {
    "allow": [],
    "read": []
  }
}
```

You can customize the scaffold:

shell

```
# Include specific security groups
nono profile init my-agent --extends default --groups python_runtime,node_runtime

# Add a description
nono profile init my-agent --extends default --description "My custom AI agent"

# Generate a full skeleton with all sections
nono profile init my-agent --extends default --full

# Write to a specific path
nono profile init my-agent --output ./my-agent-profile.json
```

### Fill in the Profile [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#fill-in-the-profile)

Using the paths discovered by `nono learn`, populate the filesystem section. The key fields:

json

```
{
  "extends": "default",
  "meta": {
    "name": "my-agent",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Custom sandboxed AI agent"
  },
  "security": {
    "groups": ["python_runtime"]
  },
  "filesystem": {
    "allow": ["~/.local/share/my-agent"],
    "read": ["~/.config/my-agent", "~/.cache/huggingface"],
    "write": ["/tmp/my-agent-workspace"]
  },
  "network": {
    "block": false
  },
  "workdir": {
    "access": "readwrite"
  }
}
```

**Filesystem field meanings:**

- `allow` \-\- read+write access to directories (recursive)
- `read` \-\- read-only access to directories (recursive)
- `write` \-\- write-only access to directories (recursive)
- `allow_file` / `read_file` / `write_file` \-\- same, but for single files instead of directories

Paths support the variables `$HOME`, `$TMPDIR`, `$UID`, and `$WORKDIR`.

### Inheritance [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#inheritance)

The `extends` field lets profiles build on each other. When you extend `default`, your agent automatically gets all deny groups (credential protection, browser data blocking, dangerous command prevention) plus system path access. Your profile only needs to specify what's unique to your application.

### Policy Patches [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#policy-patches)

For advanced control, the `policy` section lets you modify the resolved group set:

json

```
{
  "policy": {
    "exclude_groups": ["deny_shell_configs"],
    "add_deny_access": ["/path/to/extra/sensitive/dir"],
    "override_deny": ["~/.bashrc"]
  }
}
```

- `exclude_groups` removes groups from the resolved set (note: groups marked `required` in policy.json cannot be excluded)
- `add_deny_access` adds extra deny rules beyond what groups provide
- `override_deny` exempts specific paths from deny groups (the path must also be explicitly granted access)

### Validate Before Deploying [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#validate-before-deploying)

shell

```
nono policy validate ~/.config/nono/profiles/my-agent.json
```

### Run Your Agent [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#run-your-agent)

shell

```
nono run --profile my-agent -- python my_agent.py
```

The sandbox is now enforced at the OS kernel level. Your agent can only access exactly what the profile permits. Any unauthorized file access or command execution fails with a permission error.

## The Full Workflow [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#the-full-workflow)

Here's the complete loop:

shell

```
# 1. Discover what your agent needs
nono learn -- python my_agent.py

# 2. Understand what's already protected
nono policy groups deny_credentials
nono policy show default

# 3. Create a profile scaffold
nono profile init my-agent --extends default --groups python_runtime

# 4. Edit the profile with discovered paths
$EDITOR ~/.config/nono/profiles/my-agent.json

# 5. Validate it
nono policy validate ~/.config/nono/profiles/my-agent.json

# 6. Test with learn to check for gaps
nono learn --profile my-agent -- python my_agent.py

# 7. Run sandboxed
nono run --profile my-agent -- python my_agent.py
```

Step 6 is the key iteration step. Run `nono learn --profile my-agent` and if it reports no additional paths needed, your profile is complete. If it shows gaps, add the missing paths and repeat.

## What Gets Blocked [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#what-gets-blocked)

To give a concrete sense of what nono prevents, here's what happens when an agent running under the `default` profile tries to access protected resources:

- **Reading `~/.ssh/id_rsa`** \-\- blocked by `deny_credentials`
- **Reading `~/.bash_history`** \-\- blocked by `deny_shell_history`
- **Running `rm -rf /`** \-\- blocked by `dangerous_commands`
- **Reading browser cookies** \-\- blocked by `deny_browser_data_macos` / `deny_browser_data_linux`
- **Accessing `~/.aws/credentials`** \-\- blocked by `deny_credentials`

These protections are enforced by the OS kernel. The agent process cannot bypass them, escalate privileges, or disable the sandbox after it's applied. There is no escape hatch by design.

## Summary [Link to section](https://nono.sh/blog/nono-learn-policy-profile\#summary)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `nono learn` | Trace your application to discover required filesystem paths and network endpoints |
| `nono policy groups` | Inspect available security groups and their rules |
| `nono policy profiles` | List built-in and user profiles |
| `nono policy show` | View the fully resolved capabilities of a profile |
| `nono policy diff` | Compare two profiles side by side |
| `nono policy validate` | Check a profile for structural and reference errors |
| `nono profile init` | Scaffold a new profile JSON file |
| `nono profile schema` | Output the JSON Schema for editor validation |
| `nono profile guide` | Print the profile authoring guide |

The combination of automated discovery, transparent policy inspection, and profile tooling means you don't have to guess what your agent needs or manually audit system call traces. `nono learn` tells you what paths are required, `nono policy` shows you what's already protected, and `nono profile` gives you the structure to lock it all down.

For a deeper walkthrough, start with the docs on [how nono learn traces command behavior](https://nono.sh/docs/cli/features/learn) and then review [policy introspection for built-in groups and profiles](https://nono.sh/docs/cli/features/policy-introspection). Together, they give you the quickest path from discovery to a production-ready sandbox profile.

description: Guce errors occur when required authentication fails during access to
  Yahoo services. This indicates potential issues in session management or third-party
  cookie policies. Technical implications suggest a need for enhanced error handling
  and user feedback mechanisms. The persistence of such issues may impact user engagement
  and data retrieval efficiency. Monitoring and optimizing authentication flows are
  essential to mitigate disruptions and improve user experience.

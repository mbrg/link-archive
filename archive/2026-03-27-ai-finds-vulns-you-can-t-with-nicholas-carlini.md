description: In the podcast "AI Finds Vulns You Can't" featuring Nicholas Carlini,
  the discussion revolves around utilizing advanced AI models, like Claude, for vulnerability
  research. Carlini highlights recent advancements enabling LLMs to autonomously discover
  actual bugs with minimal prompting, thus increasing accessibility for vulnerability
  assessment. His team discovered around 500 zero-day vulnerabilities via tools like
  OSS-fuzz. While models show promise in finding bugs, effective exploiting and patching
  remains complex. The ongoing evolution of AI capabilities poses significant implications
  for software security, necessitating vigilance and adaptive defensive strategies
  against potential AI-driven exploits.

_This rough transcript has not been edited and may have errors._

**David:** Sounds like a really bitter lesson to learn.

**Thomas:** Yeah, I was going to say it’s terrible. It actually is terrible,
right?

**Nicholas:** Yes.

**Thomas:** All of the fun problems are gone.

**Deirdre:** Hello and welcome to Security Cryptography Whatever. I’m
Deirdre.

**David:** I’m David.

**Thomas:** Thomas.

**Deirdre:** And we have a set special guest today. Our returning champion
for vulnerability research, I think, Nicholas Carlini. Hi, Nicholas.

**Nicholas:** Hello.

**Deirdre:** Hi. We had to have you back because you, I think you wrote a
blog post that Thomas was giddy over and basically saying how vulnerability
researchers who once were able to find a bug class and then point their guns
at software, crank the handle, and get lots and lots of vulns out of it by
trying to find instances of that bug class are now gonna have to work a lot
harder to crank that handle. Can you tell us a bit about what you wrote?

**Nicholas:** Or less, or less so.

**David:** Yeah, go ahead.

**Thomas:** But like, just before we jump in, right? So, I don’t know, like 2
weeks ago, 3 weeks ago, there was like a security nerd conference about AI
and security called Unprompted. Um, I was like on the program committee for
part of it, but I did no work. My name should not be on there at all. It was,
I had life stuff going on, but, uh, Nicholas presented, um, some of the same
stuff from like this, from this, like there was this Anthropic Red blog post
from February, I think, um, which got like a lot of coverage because it
claimed to have generated 500 zero-day vulnerabilities, which is a, um, you
know, kind of a grabby stat. And then Nicholas kind of presented some of the
same work at Unprompted, um, and it kind of really lit people up. So I’m
really psyched to kind of have a conversation about that whole space of
stuff, Nicholas, that you’ve been working on. And, um, we, me and Deirdre
have not done a great job of introducing it.

**Nicholas:** Yeah, I’m sorry.

**Thomas:** So, so I’ll let you, I’ll let you take it from the top, just kind
of what, what you’re, what you’re kind of working on, and then I’ll drill
into it.

**Nicholas:** Yeah. Okay. So the basic setup that we’ve been trying to
understand is how bad is it going to get when you have these language models
that are getting increasingly capable and they are now able to be used to try
and find vulnerabilities and potentially exploit them. And so the reason why
I’m curious about this, yeah, I don’t know, many years ago I used to do pen
testing stuff and this was like the thing that got me into security in large
part. And, uh, for a long time when I was doing security in machine learning,
the only thing you could do was you could attack the machine learning models
because like they were too dumb. Um, but like, I don’t know, within the last
like year or so, 6 months, the models have gotten good enough that you can do
security, meaning use the models to help you with security. And so the thing
we’ve been trying to understand is, yeah, what, what can you do? And it’s
been growing from basically very, very little to, yeah, as of last month, a
couple months ago, like you can actually use them to find real bugs that
people care about in the world. And so we’ve been trying to understand both
where things are right now, but maybe more importantly to me, you know, where
things are going in the near future because the models have been getting a
lot better and this, like, I see no immediate end in sight in like, let’s say
the next 6 to 12 months. And so I’m like trying to understand like what are
the bugs we’re able to find now? And then can we like try and roughly
extrapolate what we’ll be able to find in 6 months or 12 months?

**Thomas:** Like a couple of different places I kind of wanna go with
this. The first thing though is like you’re saying like there’s been
improvements to the models lately such that they’re now able to find
vulnerabilities. But like for people that were, you know, kind of building
pen test type tooling before and were also using like the responses API or
any other API for any LLM, like it’s been possible to use an LLM to find
vulnera— to find real vulnerabilities for quite a while, right? Like, um, if
you have like a harness set up for it, like if you have the right set of
prompts for it and like whether or not it like, it one-shots a vulnerability
for you, it will give you essentially, it’s been like for probably more than
a year, um, like LLMs have been a reasonable way to get enough information to
get like a really strong hypothesis about a vulnerability somewhere, right?
What’s, what’s the difference between that, like the status quo ante and
where we are now with the stuff that you’re talking about?

**Nicholas:** Yeah. Okay. So yeah, so even like, um, you know, Google
DeepMind has had a project looking at doing this for a long time. Uh, OpenAI
had announced something like 7, 8 months ago looking at this. Yeah, this is
definitely a thing that if you tried hard, you can definitely get the models
to find bugs for you. The thing that we’ve been finding most recently is you
don’t really have to try very hard. We have, I don’t know, let’s say, 10-line
Bash script plus Docker container. I just sort of point it at the thing and
be like, I’ve compiled this program with ASan. Please run against it, read
the source code, and try to find a bug. That makes ASAN trigger. And
depending on which program you’re looking at, sometimes more often than not,
it comes back to you with an input that makes ASAN trigger. And this is not
always a problem. Sometimes it’s just some stupid, it’s now gonna read from
null or something. But every once in a while it gives you a much worse
version of this. And if you ask it nicely and say, please disregard all of
your null pointer dereferences, then it’s even more likely to find something
that’s important for you. You don’t really have to put in a huge amount of
work, which is both good and bad. It’s nice because it makes it easier to
find a lot of bugs. But in a world where the only people who could find these
bugs were the people who put a bunch of work in, there was some barrier to
entry and it’s not the case that just any random person could ask it to find
a bunch of bugs for them. There still is a lot of work that you as a human
have to do. But again, rate of progress. Previously had to like fancy
scaffolding and now you could just like open up, you know, Claude code or
Codex or whatever and just like point it at something and say, find me a
crash and it more or less will succeed. And this is getting, um, you know,
only easier.

**Thomas:** Okay. So like the, the headline from like the blog post and
presumably the talk is like this 500 vulnerability, this 500 zero-day
vulnerability thing, right? So there’s like, I’m kind of inferring from that,
that there’s like a discrete project inside of Anthropic to like find a bunch
of vulnerabilities. So like, I guess one thing I’m really curious about is
what that project looked like, who that project was, who was working on
it. How’d you guys pick targets? Like what, what was the project internally?

**Nicholas:** Yeah. So there are a number of things that we’ve been
doing. That was the result of a somewhat old project where we took OSS fuzz
and instead of running fuzzers, on the, you know, the harness endpoints. We
like ran a language model and said, you are a fuzzer, you know, your job is
to find an input that triggers ASan, you know, where like now, like you’re
instrumenting right into the middle of whatever the thing is at the ASan
point, sorry, at like the fuzzer point and like trying to trigger some crash,
which is useful, but like, It has some problems. Lots of times you find
things that can never be triggered from the real code. There are some
harnesses for OSS fuzz that have bugs in them. And so you find occasionally
the model will find a bug in the harness. It will just constantly return to
you. In the JavaScript ones in particular, there are some that you can
basically escape your way out of the JavaScript string. And when you’re being
called into V8, we got a bunch of fake-style JavaScript bugs where it was
actually just escaping the harness and then just crashing the outside
program. But okay, yeah, so there’s various program reasons why this is not
perfect, but this is the first thing that we started with because it’s about
the simplest thing that you could look for. And even in this, we found a huge
number of crashes that are like, yeah, heap buffer overflow writes, various
things that are very harmful. And the other reason why we picked this is we
were looking for something that people could say, or they couldn’t say this
is random code that was untested. We wanted code that OSS fuzz has tested
this for a very long time. We have found crashes in this code that is
different than what the fuzzers found. And it’s not the case that we’re the
first person to have ever looked at this. This is why what we found is at
least marginally interesting. Now the models have gotten a lot better since
then. And so now we could just Recently we’ve just pointed them at the Linux
kernel and be like, find crashes for me and it succeeds. And so this has
gotten a lot better, but the initial thing that we started with the 500 bugs
was mostly from OSS-Fuzz.

**Deirdre:** And you’re pretty sure that it’s the model is doing whatever it
thinks emulating a fuzzer is rather than calling out to a fuzzer or whatever.

**Nicholas:** Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So we don’t actually literally say you’re a
fuzzer. We actually say you’re playing in a CTF. The goal is to trigger ASAN,
but we do this in part so that the model doesn’t refuse. But, okay. So why
are we pretty sure it’s not just calling out to a fuzzer? Because presumably
this is part of OSS-Fuzz. If calling out to the fuzzer was all you had to do,
then we would’ve been found before. And so this is the main thing that we’re
relatively sure there. But also we just have been reading a bunch of the bugs
and you could just look at the traces and it’s just very, very clear. That
the things that it’s finding are not the like, you know, fuzz sort of found
findings. Cool.

**Thomas:** You guys, you guys do not have a special model where you don’t
have to pretend that you’re in a CTF for.

**Nicholas:** We, we’ve just been using the production model that everyone
else in the world has access to. Yeah, I mean, we get the model a little
before everyone because, you know, we’re training it. But the model that we
were using has been deployed.

**Thomas:** How, how focused are you on memory corruption in this work?

**Nicholas:** Yeah. Okay. So initially we were very focused on it because it
gives a very, very nice oracle, right? Like, if I sort of have a copy of the
program running in a separate VM with the compiled with ASan, and then the
first model gives to me a binary and I give it to the other one and I run it
on there. And if the other one crashes with the binary on with an ASan crash,
then I’m like, okay, great, this is a bug. And so we did this. We, for
example, we ran this on Firefox with Opus 4.6 and we sent Mozilla 122
crashing inputs and like they confirmed all of these are bugs. Like 100% of
the things we crashed them, perfect true positive rate, all bugs. Because we
have a perfect crash oracle and they’re sort of competent security people who
understand that if you have an input that’s crashing ASAN, like you should,
actually treat this as something that’s worth looking at. And so like they,
they sort of treated them all as bugs. Now some of them were not, you know,
high severity sort of potential escape vulnerabilities. And so they triaged,
I don’t remember exactly how many, I think it was 22 total of them got CVEs
that because they thought they were like bad enough. And so the rest were,
you know, crashing inputs that were, are bad, but, um, are not like
immediately, it’s not immediately clear how you would exploit this. And so
they didn’t triage these as, high severity vulnerabilities that need
CVEs. But like, this is why we started with memory corruption as the thing,
because you can get this very, very nice oracle. We’ve since additionally
tried to do other things that don’t have such a nice oracle. So somewhat
recently I pointed it at a bunch of content management systems and have been
finding— such as? Okay, so the best one that we have is an example. There’s
this project called Ghost. Which has, I don’t know, it’s like 50,000 stars on
GitHub or something.

**David:** Oh, so like, yeah, it’s like WordPress but in Node.

**Deirdre:** Got it. Okay.

**Nicholas:** Yeah.

**Deirdre:** So literally like CMSs, but yeah. Okay.

**Nicholas:** Sure.

**David:** Yeah.

**Nicholas:** It was like standard web apps.

**Thomas:** And Ghost is an important target. Like there’s a lot of people
running Ghost. Yeah.

**Nicholas:** Yeah.

**David:** I used to run Ghost and I was paranoid about running it and I put
its login behind an additional OAuth2 proxy because I was very worried about
it.

**Nicholas:** Yeah. Yeah. So Ghost was actually pretty good. So Ghost in the
history of the project on their, like, you know, security tracker has never
had, like, a critical severity bug before. Before. Before. Yeah. And then
Opus 4.6 found one. And so it found a SQL injection that goes, nice, an
unauthenticated user who has literally no perms, who can compromise the admin
database, mint themself a new admin account, and then log themself in and
yeah, complete complete account takeover. And it was like, so not only did it
find the vulnerability, it also wrote the exploit, which was like a
non-trivial blind SQL injection where you only control some parameter after a
WHERE clause. And so you can’t actually do things. You can either parse or
not parse invalidly a JSON object. And so then you have to see whether you
got a 500 or a 403, and then you sort of do some binary search to read out
the keys, it wrote the whole thing for me. And yeah, it was quite a bad
bug. But yeah, this one we didn’t have a grader, so it was a little bit
harder to do. But the models have gotten good enough that most of the time
you can just have them write a report and then you have them read the report
and you ask, here’s a report that I received from someone. Is this real? Can
you go and replicate this on the thing or not? To separate instance of the
model. Then it will go off and say, here’s the following flaws that I
found. I don’t think it’s quite as real. We run this critiquer over all of
them. Then after that’s done, then we look at the highest severity ones
ranked by this critique agent. Then we filed a couple of these ones that were
the highest severity. This isn’t as perfect and clean as an oracle. We’ve
been doing this only more recently once the models have gotten good enough
that we can trust them for this. But I think it’s highly likely that the
world is going to move more and more in this direction where you can just
trust that for the most part, most of the time, the models are good. But
again, these ones we are very, very careful to manually review all of them. I
have walked through the trace of myself. I spun up the thing because I’m
still very paranoid the model is just going to lie to me. I don’t want to be
the person generating AI slop. This will be very bad.

**Thomas:** Like we can, yeah, we can let you off the hook for having to
hedge about this for the rest of this whole time, right? Like we assume that
you’re like, you know, you’re verifying things before you send them upstream
and all that. I wanna lock in on like the methodology here. So, so with the,
with the ASAN builds, with the memory corruption oracle, it’s kind of easy to
see how you would kind of build that out. Like intuitively it’s like you also
have like giant fuzzer farms that produce crashes and like the, the li— like
the limiting reagent there is how much time people have to go verify all
those dump crashes. And you have kind of infinite ability to verify crashes
and that wall. And that’s not, I get the impression that’s not actually what
you’re doing. Like really, like OSS fuzz is just kind of like a, it’s itself
a harness to give the LLM access to, you know, the code and the environment
and all that. But like, I assume it’s predicting vulnerabilities from code as
well as from behavior, right? But you have like a, you have a really good,
you have both a really good oracle for knowing when you found a
vulnerability, but also like, um, it knows how to find the memory corruption
vulnerability, like the space of different, like C and C++
vulnerabilities. Like they’re interesting vulnerabilities and they’re very
corner casey. There’s lots of bank shots you have to take to get them to work
and all that. But the core idea of the vulnerability is simple. There aren’t
that many of them, right? Which is not the case for a CMS. So my question is,
when you’re doing something like finding a SQL injection in Ghost, right? How
much prompting are you giving it about what a SQL injection is?

**Nicholas:** Zero. Yeah, again, so like we sort of, I wrote a single prompt,
which was the same for all of the content management systems, which is, I
would like you to audit the security of this codebase. This is a CMS. You
have complete access to this Docker container. It is running. Please find a
bug. And then I might give a hint. “Please look at this file.” And I’ll give
different files each time I invoke it in order to inject some randomness,
right? Because the model is gonna do roughly the same time each time you run
it. And so if I want to have it be really thorough, instead of just running
100 times on the same project, I’ll run it 100 times, but each time say, “Oh,
look at this login file, look at this other thing.” And just enumerate every
file in the project basically. I’ll filter out the files that are header
files or okay, it’s whatever in Node. So it’s not header files, but I’ll
filter out the files that have obviously nothing interesting going on in them
and then just give it the files that have plausibly security-relevant
code. And again, I use a language model for this. I run it over all the
files. I say, rate on a scale of 1 to 5, how likely is this file to have
something interesting in it? And then it just like discard the ones that are
1s and 2s and then I keep the 3, 4, 5 and then I just run it on this and say,
please find me a bug. And yeah, sometimes it gives me SQL injection,
sometimes it gives me, you know, login bypasses, sometimes it gives me XSS,
sometimes it gives me CSRF. Yeah, just like, it knows what all the bugs are.

**Thomas:** Okay. And you’re literally automating Claude here, like the CLI
Claude, you’re not driving the API.

**Nicholas:** No, I run Claude code, you know, you can run Claude code in a
mode, dangerously skip permissions, which means just like, don’t ask me for
anything. You can do whatever you want. I give it a prompt. The prompt is,
yeah, I don’t know. It’s like maybe in practice 30 lines or something. I
don’t know what the prompt says. I didn’t even write the prompt. I asked
Claude to write the agent that finds the bugs and just like, you know, I just
told it what to do. And then it goes off and runs until it finds something
and then it writes a report. And then I run these critique agents on all the
reports. And then at the end of the critique agent, I ask it to write a CVSS
score, which are fake, but it’s good enough that I can just grep for CVSS
9876 and then just find stuff and then go through them. Okay.

**Thomas:** So when you, in this kind of contraption that you’ve set up here,
right? Like, are you, it sounds like you’re doing multiple runs against
Ghost, say, like, and like those runs, like most of them don’t pay off. Like
you just keep doing it until you get— Yeah, right.

**Nicholas:** I mean, like, yeah, I, I run it for almost literally every file
in the program and the project set that has something interesting. I then try
to have each one write a report and I tell the model, maybe there’s nothing
here. If there’s nothing here, just write no findings. Then I run the
critique agent over all of them. A good model most of the time will tell you
no findings and then it will find a bunch of some things. Sometimes it turns
out that it’s like the most common failure mode is early on in the session,
the model adds some code to some debug thing that gives it a bypass so that
it can log in without permissions. And then later on, after it’s compacted
the summary multiple times, context window is cleared 5 times, it finds a bug
which it added a while ago and is entirely fake. And then it’s like, oh, I
found something. And then you have the triage agent run and the triage agent
runs it on the clean image and it’s like, what do you mean? This is clearly
not a bug and it will remove it. And you end up with a bunch of these kinds
of things.

**Thomas:** But there was, I’m asking this because there was last year, I
think in the middle of last year, somebody wrote a blog post about how they
had found, I think it was Linux I think it’s called WiFi or something. They
found a kernel vulnerability using, I, I forget which model it was, right?
But like for, for me, like the nut graph of that piece, like the core of that
piece was like they were running it thousands of times, right?

**Nicholas:** Oh, right.

**Deirdre:** Yeah.

**Thomas:** They’re burning like a zillion. I don’t, by the way, I don’t care
about how many tokens you’re spending. The whole token economy thing seems
very silly to me, but like they’re running it, they’re running it a thousand
times and like one of those runs pays off with something actually
interesting, right? Is that, is it a similar situation for you or are you
just iterating over the files and that’s the only iteration that you do?

**Nicholas:** Yeah, so I’m just iterating over the files. It’s definitely not
1 in 1,000. I don’t know what the exact rate is, but you know, okay. Like of
course there’s a spectrum of—

**Thomas:** Each time you, each time you, each time you give it a new file to
look at, right? You’re really just giving it a new entry point into the code,
right?

**Nicholas:** Exactly. I don’t even force it to like read that file. There’s
no constraint. Like there’s like literally a line that’s like, you know,
please look at, and then I, you know, bracket, you know, file name, end
bracket. And then in Python I just like, you know, format this and like plop
in whatever file name I want. And like this gives it an entry point to like,
you know, launch off looking from there. And sometimes it finds a different
bug somewhere else. But yeah, I, I don’t do any like fancy stuff here.

**Thomas:** I’m stuck on like, so first of all, I said there is like, there
were some screenshots of the presentation that you gave it unprompted and
like one of them, that, um, that got posted and people were like, liked it or
whatever. It’s just that you believe that Claude is a better vulnerability
researcher than you are. And I worked with you in the past and I already knew
that Claude was a better vulnerability researcher than you were. But, um, but
there was also like, there, there was like, there was the— Nicholas wrote all
of the good parts of MicroCorruption. Um, Nicholas is much better than I
am. I, I’m saying I’m really, really bad, but like, um, there was another
slide which I actually found dispiriting, which was just like your, your,
like the slide where you’re kind of talking about the methodology is just you
showing Claude dangerously skip permissions, find me a zero-day
vulnerability, right? So like that by itself is surprising to me. And like as
a nerd who wants to like look at this thing like an analog synth with lots of
different things to plug in together and lots of cool toys to do, I’m a
little bit disappointed that there isn’t more room for little, you know,
making little toys and I’ll get back to that. But also like this whole idea
of, so each, each iteration that you’re doing over the files, which is just
like, giving it a little hint, maybe start this like here this time and maybe
start there next time, right? So essentially you’re just kind of randomizing,
like what you’re really doing is just like doing like a randomized like
start-freeze thing. Why do you ever stop?

**Nicholas:** Uh, as there are more things in the world to attack. Okay. But
like, yeah.

**Thomas:** When, when you’re done with that loop, do you feel very confident
about the security of say Ghost?

**Nicholas:** No. Yeah, so if we run this over the loop once, we, so okay, so
when we found the 500 bugs in a bunch of OSS things, OSS fuzz things, I think
we ran over every project, sorry, over every entry point maybe 20 times or
something just to be even more thorough. And there are some entry points that
we only found bugs 2 outta 20 times. And when I run over, so eventually I ran
over the Linux kernel. When I did the Linux kernel, I ran over every file in
the kernel that I thought was interesting and reachable from user space and
whatever bunch of stuff, maybe like 5 or 10 times. And there are like
sometimes where like it finds a bug and sometimes where it doesn’t. And so
like, I don’t have like a very nice like scientific plot yet on like, you
know, extrapolating where this is going to plateau. But the main reason why
we stop is because there’s enough software in the world where after we’ve run
it a couple times, we’re like, okay, we’ve sort of gotten a bunch of bugs
here. Let’s move on and try and not spend all of our time on exactly one
piece of software and distribute it amongst all of them. There’s enough code
in the world that you could do only one pass over each project and be running
for a very long time.

**Deirdre:** Do you have your own homegrown spidey sense of being a
vulnerability researcher about which files you’re like, all right, you’ve
given it a pass or two, but like, I really want you to do like 5 or 10 passes
before I feel comfortable moving on. Or I feel like you’re not going
anywhere.

**Nicholas:** Yeah. I, I probably could, like if I went and looked at the
files individually, I could probably do this better than the model still a
little bit. But like, I don’t, um, like I just like pointed at the project
and just be like, find me things. The reason why is just the scale is
enormous. It’s like on the slide of, I said the models are better
vulnerability researchers than me. It’s not the case that if you gave the
model a very small piece of code that was self-contained and 300 lines long
and I could reason and it could reason the same amount of time on that piece
of code, I would win. I’m still more intelligent than the model, but what I
can’t do is analyze literally every program or every C file in the entire
Linux kernel and try to find bugs. I will spend most of my time having a
really good intuition about where to look, but the model doesn’t need the
intuition. It could just look everywhere. It’s something so much faster and
cheaper that half of its work will be completely wasted ‘cause it’s looking
in drivers that aren’t even loaded. And fine, that’s fine. We waste that. I
will just go look at the points where there is actually something to be
found. Eventually, and then it will come back with interesting bugs that have
been dormant for decades.

**Deirdre:** Even for the short ones, I feel like you both can achieve the
same result, but I feel like the model might be able to do it faster than
you.

**Nicholas:** Well, certainly they’re enormously fast. Yeah, especially like
Thomas, you were saying, the model, there are only so many classes of bugs. I
don’t know, security people like to think of themselves as brilliant sort of
whatever people, but I don’t know, honestly, it’s just like there’s some
amount of just like, you need to know what the classes of bugs are that
people have found. And like 90% of doing vulnerability research is like,
okay, let’s like pattern match this on the thing that we’ve seen before. And
like there’s differences every single time. But like you can imagine that
like if you had read all of the code on all of GitHub or something, then like
you would be very, very good at pattern matching against whatever the
use-after-free pattern that this one in particular needed.

**Deirdre:** Yeah.

**David:** So, like, I wanna get back to whether or not, like, oh, you
switched to a new thing because there’s like so many things to look at. Um,
but also we’re in like, we’ll just like find something to pattern match on
and we could in theory just like keep pattern matching until it’s gone. So
like, I kind of remember when like fuzzing, it wasn’t, wasn’t new, but like
OSS fuzz was new.

**Deirdre:** Yeah.

**David:** And like, uh, uh, like some people like popped out like, you know,
let’s say like 10 CVEs in every single codec for like a year in like 2015.

**Nicholas:** 2016 or something.

**Thomas:** I don’t know.

**David:** Um, and then everyone was like, wow, this is amazing. We’re just
going to fuzz all these things. And like fuzzing found like 10 bugs in every
single library. And then like people kept running fuzzers for years and those
like OSS fuzz, like, like you said, it like doesn’t find a whole lot of new
bugs. Like there’s definitely like people working at offensive firms that
like figure out a new way to jury-rig up a cluster, uh, a cluster of ones to
fuzz like some in slightly new way. It pops out 10 bugs. And it doesn’t find
anymore. Um, or like people who build careers doing that to submit to bug
bounties. ‘Cause it’s just like, it, it turns out it’s like, it’s not
actually enumerating the bug space. And it’s also far, far easier to like
jury-rig some fuzzer for like a month than it is to like run it consistently
over time. So like, in terms of cost-benefit analysis for defenders, it’s,
it’s like helpful, but it’s, it’s not exhausting the space.

**Nicholas:** Mm-hmm.

**David:** But also we don’t necessarily see like a ton, a ton, a ton of like
fuzzing bugs, like 10x, you know, every month. So when it comes to like bugs
found by, uh, like agents again, or, or tools like Claude Code, like you can
throw it at like some files and say like, find me bugs. And then there’s a
round of that. And then people can jury-rig it up a little better to find
more bugs. But like, do you think that we could exhaustively like actually
make a piece of software more secure in the sense of like, we removed a bunch
of the bugs and like, if we all run these agents for the next 2 months, like
we’ll have found all of the bugs that agents are going to find aside from the
margins, and it will go back to like, there are 10 people in their basement
submitting the bug bounties and what are the tools they have as agents? Or is
there an infinite plethora of bugs? Like, there’s something to be said about
the population of bugs and then like how these agents are finding them. And
like, are we approaching zero or yeah.

**Nicholas:** Okay. I think it’s a very good question. High-level answer, I
don’t know. I think, yeah, I wish I knew the answer. This would be great to
know, but yeah, not yet. Okay. Yeah, me too. Jesus Christ, that’d help a lot
of work. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So first answer is that even if it was the case
that you could exhaust all of the bugs with one specific language model, it’s
still the case that these models are getting a lot better over time. And so
you can imagine a world where we exhaust all of the bugs that can be found
with, you know, Opus 4.6. And OpenAI comes out and releases GPT-5.4, which
they did, I don’t know, whatever, 2 weeks ago. And then like maybe this one
finds a bunch of new bugs. And then Google comes around and releases
Gemini. Let’s see, they’re on 3.1. So they released 3.2 and this one like
finds a bunch of new bugs. Like, so you could imagine a world where even if
you could exhaust all the bugs with one model, like we’re still in this
increasing exponential capabilities. And like it seems likely to me that we
will be stay there for a little while longer. So there’s this aspect of
it. And then the other aspect is, I like to think of this as like, okay, so
fuzzers find a restricted class of bugs that are fairly easy to
enumerate. And so it’s fairly small, the attack surface is fairly low. And
this means that once you’ve probed it a bunch, you can sort of have hardened
that shell. As you get better and the models are able to find, attack a
larger attack surface, you have to do more work to exhaustively find all of
the bugs that can be scanned in that surface. And each time the models get
better, the space of attacks grows again. So now that we can have pretty good
bug finding without Oracle that gives you ASAN crashes, this gives you
another attack surface that you can start to measure against. And I think
that each time you do this, you have to do more work to make sure that you’ve
done like, pigeonhole principle, whatever, like you need to have done a huge
amount of work in order to make sure you’ve found all of the bugs, even if
they were finite. And each time that you increase the surface, it gets even
harder. And so this is maybe my other concern is it may be the case that it’s
finite, but you could imagine that, yeah, the more powerful models might have
a bigger surface to hit between.

**David:** Really? And so getting back into that, like, for the Firefox
example, then, like, do you have like an estimate in terms of even if it’s
finite, like not getting there, do you have an estimate to how much time it
took Firefox engineers to patch all, what was it like 50 bugs or whatever it
is? Relative to how long like Claude ran, um, to find, and then even for, for
say you to validate, um, let, let’s include the time that you or anyone else
at Anthropic spent validating the bugs. Mm-hmm. Um, relative to how long it
took Firefox to, to patch them. And then not to like knock on like, not like
if Firefox shelves some of them, like let’s not count that time. Just like
actual time spent by engineers trying to patch these things.

**Nicholas:** Yeah. So I don’t know exactly how much time Firefox spent. Um,
the bugs that we found there were found by one person, Iftikhar, who, yeah,
was working for, I don’t know, not more than a month on some harnessing,
probably a couple weeks. Probably most of this was reusable work because
like, I don’t know.

**Deirdre:** Okay.

**Nicholas:** Some people—

**David:** Yeah, it takes a while to rig a browser, but once you’ve done it
once, it’s copy and rig.

**Nicholas:** Yes. But some, like, he sort of did it properly and like hooked
it up into the Anthropic infrastructure in the right way. I sort of do some
things just like, I don’t know, I just turn on a bunch of Docker containers
on the same machine. I go grab a machine with 100 cores and just call it a
day and just run it over a weekend. Other people do actual engineering and
make it properly distributed. He did it that way. So it’s like a reusable
infrastructure that if he wanted to spin on something else, he could do
that. And so, I don’t know how much of the work was on this, but it was not
more than a couple weeks of work. To like harness the whole thing up. And
then yeah, we like let the models go and churn for a while and then we sent
off the bugs. So yeah, I think we sort of got most of the bugs that we could
find with, with Opus 4.6. But like, I don’t know, my guess is if we were to
run it for the same amount of time, we’d come up with a couple of more. I
don’t know how many, we should probably have some numbers here at some
point. I’m hoping to try and run some like science-y experiments, like
measuring these curves over time. But like, we don’t have that quite
yet. It’s like still, yeah, very early.

**Thomas:** Mm-hmm.

**David:** But so we can probably then like at least estimate on the short
end, you spent, let’s say 2 weeks and then let’s say each bug took an
engineer day for Firefox to patch of, of those 30. And so that’s at least
like roughly 2x the engineering time to fix the bugs than it was to find the
bugs. And that’s including like reusable engineering time.

**Nicholas:** Yeah. Also then like the, it’s like just legitimately harder to
patch than it is to find these.

**Thomas:** Yes.

**Nicholas:** Because like you can’t make functionality, like you can’t just
like, like the, the model Oracles are great because finding crashing inputs
gives you the most perfect oracle. But if someone wants to fix it, you have
to understand first how it happened. Actually, as a sort of aside, language
models are actually very nice because while they don’t always give you a
perfect explanation of what went wrong, it’s so much easier than, “Here is a
fuzz crash.” Just like, “Here’s some binary.” The bugs that we have come with
Python programs that generated them. And so like, even if you, like, it sort
of misunderstands why, like you can at least like, okay, so, so it’s a
little, they, they, the Firefox people found it a little bit easier to
actually fix these than like normal fuzz crashes. But yeah, like they did
have to spend quite a lot of work on like, you know, making sure that what
they’re going to submit is not gonna like break some user functionality. And
so I think this is one of the asymmetries here.

**David:** And you were kind enough to give them effectively 100% valid
bugs. Uh, ‘cause another approach could be to just use the bug bounty as an
additional oracle, um, uh, to help with, with, with the—

**Nicholas:** and some people in the past have, have tried this and have
gotten many people mad at them. And yes, we are trying very hard to not have—

**Deirdre:** also the latency on that oracle is pretty, pretty large.

**David:** Like from, from Chrome side, like relative to February 2024, David
eating his feelings here. 2025 had 5 times the submissions. Um, and then
March of 2026, today’s the 19th, already has, um, over twice as many
submissions as the entirety of February did. Um, and you know, some of that
is our own like damn fault for, um, uh, basically being particularly like
lenient and nice for years. Um, because that was like You know, what we, uh,
um, there’s just the way that the Chrome VRP has been known for, like, being
very easy access to get to engineers. And so, um, but, uh, yeah.

**Nicholas:** Firefox saw the same thing. Mozilla had a plot, um, where they,
like, showed the number of bugs that were found, um, over time. And yeah, so,
like, we found, I think it was, like, 20-something, which is, I don’t
remember what the exact number was, like, 25% of all bugs that were found in
last year, we found like in one, like in one batch of reports. But what you
like, many people didn’t notice is like this, this chart had like two bars
stacked on top of each other. There’s the ones that we found and the ones
everyone else found. And it, the bar was like a lot bigger because we found
many more. But if you remove all of the bugs that we found, last month was
also the biggest month that they had seen in like the last two years.

**Deirdre:** Oh, right.

**Nicholas:** And so like, I, I can’t, I mean, I have no inside information
on, on, on Firefox. But it’s like, I can’t sort of tell you that this is
causally related, but I don’t know. It’s, it seems plausibly related.

**David:** It’s happening at every bug bounty, right? Yeah.

**Nicholas:** And, and, and this was like, to be clear, like the, like these
are the real bugs they got CVEs for. And so, you know, like the, the numbers
on submissions I’m sure are going up, but like the number of outputs is also
going up.

**Thomas:** Yeah. I think like bug bounty incentives were always kind of
weird to begin with. And these programs are all kind of like, they’re all in
a, and I guess maybe except for Google, they’re all kind of ad hoc. I don’t
worry that much. About like the long-term impacts on bug bounty programs that
people just iterate and come up with better bug bounty terms and stuff.

**David:** There’s some of that, but also like, I, I don’t worry too much
about bug bounties. I worry about the people at bug bounties on like large
platforms and browsers, like in the, the sort of near term. Um, but I, I
think like it was actually Jeff Belknap who used to work for you, Thomas, I
think, um, when he was CISO of LinkedIn, like over 10 years ago, I think he
was, he gave this talk that was like, bug bounties are stupid and you should
stop running them. Like the only people that run, that should be running bug
bounties are basically platforms. Are you an operating system or a web
browser or like a phone vendor? Sure, run a bug bounty. Otherwise, or like,
are you running other people’s code? Maybe run a bug bounty, but otherwise,
like, get over yourself. You’re, you’re just like wasting time. And I feel
like everyone’s just gonna come to that, that, that realization, like curl
did it. Is a notable example, but like everybody that’s not huge is gonna
shut their bug bounty down. And then the big bug bounties are all gonna be
much, much more strict about what they’ll accept.

**Thomas:** Yeah.

**Deirdre:** Just because of overload?

**David:** Yeah, because it’s very easy to generate a, a reasonable looking
bug report now. And that might be wrong. Like previously, like how well you
format, did you follow the format? Did you submit the requested thing? Was it
fully filled out? Was like a good proxy for are you reasonable? And now it’s
not.

**Deirdre:** Whether, whether some human should invest their time actually
validating it and testing it and trying to reproduce it and coming up with a
patch. Yeah.

**David:** You’re also gonna see more of like, yeah, you’re not allowed to
give us a bug that isn’t basically like coming with a POC unless you’ve
previously given us bugs that came with a POC and then we’ll be willing to
listen to you because you have a reputation. But like otherwise, good luck.

**Thomas:** I wanna talk more about the science of finding bugs. I wanna talk
more about like what the, what the fuck is going on here, right? So yeah.

**Nicholas:** All right.

**Thomas:** All right. So hold on a second, Nicholas, when we’re, when you’re
looking at what’s happening right now with 4.6 maybe, and just like going
straight into there, like, is it that like, is it that the models are like,
have superhuman attention spans and they’re basically doing what you and I
would do um, looking at code, but they can hold up attention over huge
amounts of code and keep lots of context in their heads and find more
stuff. And it’s just a fact, it’s just a function of thoroughness. Or is it
also the case that the models are maybe for some of the same reasons, really
good at finding intricate corner cases that even if you and I stared at
things like we can’t hold enough stuff in our heads to find all the weird
bank shot conditions that would make these things work. Is it Either or, or
both, or how much?

**Nicholas:** So far, all of the bugs that the models have spit out, once it
produces the, like, report, I can understand. Like, I can, like, it’s, like,
pretty clear to me what’s going on. Like, if it’s not yet producing reports
where I read them and I’m like, what is this?

**Deirdre:** Like, it’s like, you haven’t seen a model do, like, the
equivalent of AlphaGo, which is like, it does moves that no human would ever
see or think of. It’s not doing that yet.

**Nicholas:** I don’t know how it got there, but like, you know, the final
report, like, when I file the bug report. Like I am able to like, you know,
concisely explain in, you know, a page or two of text, like, you know, what
has happened. Sometimes these bug reports are, well, yeah, so the Linux one,
for example, this was like some, so the bug we have was, we have several of
them. One of them is in, I think this is in NFS daemon. It’s, the bug was 22
years old. Um, the bug, so in Linux, you, um, what the, the way the commit
format works is they like you to say like, you know, fixes colon, you give a
git commit hash of the, the, the commit that you’re fixing.

**Deirdre:** Yeah.

**Nicholas:** Um, uh, I couldn’t do that. So like I had to give a change set.

**Deirdre:** A fresh fix has to go back 22 years and be like, this commit is
the one that introduced this bug.

**Nicholas:** I couldn’t give a commit because the bug predates Git.

**Deirdre:** Oh my God.

**Nicholas:** And so I was like finding the change set from 2.6 that
introduced, and so like, okay, so, um, Yeah, okay, this is so like, you know,
like this clearly has something interesting going on because like, you know,
many eyes have seen this, but like when I tell you what the bug is, you know,
like you can understand it. Like, so it turned out that like there was
something where, you know, if two clients are cooperating and they take a
lock on the same file and one of them has a really big name and the other one
like gets a lock denied error, they’re like, or big person’s name gets echoed
to the other person and overflows some buffer on the heap. Like, this is like
not, you know, some obscenely complicated, like, magic that’s happening
here. It’s just like, it’s a bug that, like, you can see why this, like,
might have been hard to discover because it’s like, it requires multiple
clients that are, like, interleaving packets in the right way. And, but like,
it, it’s understandable once I tell it to you what’s going on. You know, all
bugs are shallow in some sense. Uh, at least, you know, for the moment they
still are.

**Deirdre:** That, that one reminds me of how, like, concurrency and async
always tend to be just gnarly and like part of the reason that, you know,
Chrome, not Chrome, Rust is not like completely free of concurrency and async
bugs. But it does make the severity because of the memory safety and type
safety and all the things that come out of that a lot easier to do and a lot
less severity if you, you shoot yourself in the foot, it’s logic bugs. But
that sort of bug definitely feels like of a piece of like humans are really
bad at looking at a piece of code. And transposing that to the network
topology and state machine of asynchronous clients doing a state machine
transition together.

**Nicholas:** Yep. I don’t know.

**Thomas:** I don’t know.

**Nicholas:** I wouldn’t have thought that the, a model could also reason
through that in its brain. I don’t know. I’m gonna clear it like, you know,
like through its context, like, you know, it has, it has in some sense like
understood this at some deep level in order to come up with, with this
bug. Like this is a non-trivial sort of piece of reasoning you had to do in
order to like like, you know, construct multiple clients querying in the
right order. Right. Like, you know, yeah. It’s just like, there’s like some
of these things that like are quite interesting and like, so those are one
class of bugs, um, that it finds that are interesting. The other class is
like just things that fuzzers can’t find that like are just boring.

**Thomas:** Yeah.

**Nicholas:** But just like, you know, I have so many bugs in protocols that
have checksums, like just like, you know, AFL has a very hard time generating
valid CRC32s. Um, and so like, it’s just like not a thing that you can fuzz
once you have to include this in your protocol. Um, but like language model
can just like find the bug and then write the, write the input and then
check, write a Python program, compute the like checksum, add it to the
packet and then send it off and then it crashes. And so you’ll even have
other classes of bugs.

**Thomas:** Yeah. That, that, that makes sense. ‘Cause like a fuzzer is a
brute force search, right?

**Nicholas:** Exactly.

**Thomas:** And it’s like, right. And like, yeah. Okay.

**David:** So.

**Thomas:** Okay. I thought I had more to say about that, but I had a fuzzer
is a brute force search and that’s where my insight capped off there. Keep
going. I’m sorry for interrupting you.

**Nicholas:** Oh, that’s fine. No, no, no. I mean like, yeah, this is exactly
why, right? Like even if you like start doing some kind of branch coverage
kind of thing, right? Like it’s just like, it’s very hard for AFL to like
discover the right sequence of bytes that like, you know, happens to give a
checksum that’s valid. And so it will just like very, very fast.

**Thomas:** And so yeah, it doesn’t have a, it doesn’t have a theory. It
doesn’t have a theory of the code and whatever the fuck is happening inside
the model, the model has a theory of the code. Code that it’s chasing?

**Nicholas:** Well, the model can just like ignore the— it knows that there’s
this line that says, you know, it’s gonna do like this compute CRC32. It will
reason about the rest of it. And then when it gets to the point where it
needs a CRC32 to match, it can just go run some Python code to generate the
correct CRC32 hash, add that into the, into whatever the object you need, and
then it will, it’ll pass. And so like, this is like a, a sort of the, the,
the power that the model has that like, you know, the fuzzer, which is just
looking locally at like this individual branch is like unable to to do. And
so you can find a bunch of bugs that are entirely trivial things. There’s
like another bug that we, that we just, was just patched in FFmpeg 8.1, which
again, 20-something years old. It’s a bug in H.264 introduced in the original
commit that added H.264 to FFmpeg. And it’s a bug because there’s like some
overflow where if you have some number of frames, that’s exactly, you know,
65535 frames, then you can overflow something. And like no fuzzer in the
world is going to like, you know, run through the loop 65,000 times and then
eventually have a crash, right? It’s like a very, very boring bug, but like a
fuzzer’s not gonna find it for this reason.

**Thomas:** Knowing what the code is that’s broken there, if you looked at
that code, would you have spotted it?

**Nicholas:** Maybe. I think if I gave you a one-sentence description, I
think you would find it. But like empirically, you know, the code is 20 years
old. It’s in FFmpeg, it’s in H.264. It’s not like some obscure codec. And
like it’s still present. So I mean, like, you know, knowing that there was
something to look for is like a very, very big hint, especially if I tell you
like, you know, what kind of thing you’re looking for.

**Thomas:** There was like, um, earlier this year or earlier last year,
whatever it was, right? There was the DARPA Cyber Challenge thing, right?
Mm-hmm. Where a bunch of different teams put together kind of complicated
systems for finding vulnerabilities, right? Mm-hmm. So if we, if we think
about the work that you guys were doing with FORSIX, And if you kind of
divide the universe of, you know, finding vulnerabilities with AI into like
the quality of the model, the quality of the harness and the tooling that you
build around the model and the quality of the prompting that you do, right?
Like the domain-specific knowledge you bring about the target, about the
vulnerabilities to that, that thing, right? It sounds like for the, for the
FORSIX work that you guys were doing for like the Anthropic Red 500, you
know, zero-day thing, heavily, heavily biased towards just the model. Right?
Like there wasn’t basically almost no, you know, work done at all
there. Right. And like I would’ve said before we talked just now, let’s like
this, or before I saw the slides for the, the talk and all that, right. That
like the state of the art is coming up with better and better
harnesses. Right. Like, do you see, like, do you see the result that you guys
got and the success that you got as like an indication that you have the
right allocation there? Or is it really just a function of like, you guys
have time to do this amount of stuff and also your incentive is to make the
model as good as it can possibly be at doing this stuff. And like other
people’s job can be to figure out what the best harness thing is.

**Nicholas:** Yeah, definitely some of all of these, right? Like, okay, so
like part of the reason why we are looking for these bugs is, okay, so I am
looking at these bugs ‘cause I like finding bugs.

**David:** Yes.

**Nicholas:** And the reason why Anthropic is willing to pay me to find bugs
is because like they in part just like want to understand the capabilities of
their model. They have this model, they want to know what can this thing do,
they want to ensure that it’s not going to go and cause a bunch of harm. Part
of what they care about is just tell me how good this thing that I have is in
front of me.

**Deirdre:** And what it can do, not even how good it is, what it’s capable
of in general.

**Nicholas:** Yeah, exactly. Part of the incentive structure here is just we
are in some sense incentivized to just to try get some base understanding of
what’s capable. And then I could almost certainly scaffold this better and
probably find some more bugs. But in the time I would have spent doing that,
there will be another model. And then I could just find more things. And
oftentimes you find this. Okay, so the thing that happens is you write a
harness that’s really, really, really good for a particular model. And then
the next model comes out and it’s better in ways that your harness is no
longer helpful. It’s now restrictive. Yes. So there’s a couple of nice
examples. So I did this once. So last year I wrote a paper where I had some
language models try and break some machine learning stuff. And at the time
when I did this, I started writing the harness in November of 2024. The paper
came out in January of 2025. In order to get the models to do anything
sensible, I had to say you could edit the following 6 files. You can run
exactly these 3 Python commands and do nothing else because if I give you
some agency, you will brick the machine. I couldn’t do anything. But then
today, the last couple of days, I’ve been running this harness again. And if
you run that with today’s models, they’re trying to launch jobs in the
background so that they can then read code while something else is running to
save time. And it’s a good idea. Harness needs to let you do this. There have
been some benchmarks that even other people have found There was this
science-adjacent benchmark by some folks out of Princeton where with Opus
4.5, they initially found that Opus 4.5 was scoring like 40%. I trashed their
entire harness. I just gave Claude code the harness, the thing, and I said
like solve it. And it was like 92% or something. It was just like, you know,
it’s like this is like a common thread where like, you know, you spend a
bunch of time building something fancy and the next model just like doesn’t
need that fanciness, which is not to say that this is like a useless
endeavor. But like, you know, it’s just like, you know, at the, when, when
things are increasing at the rate that they are, like, it’s kind of like kind
of hard. The time that it takes you to write the fancy harness, the next
model comes out and like, it’s good enough that like you didn’t need to have
written that harness.

**Thomas:** There’s kind of like a thing, there’s a thing with like coding
agents where if you watch carefully what’s happening there, they really kind
of collapse down to just the ability to run Bash, right? Like they only need
the one tool. They only need the one tool, but they get Python through Bash,
right? Yes. Like all they, all they need is Bash and then they can find their
way into the rest of everything else there. Right. And so like, and Awk and
stuff. But like you’re giving, you’re giving the LLM, you’re, you’re giving
4Six access to an environment that has fuzzers and debuggers in it. Like to
what extent is it using tools versus to what extent is it like looking at
code and then making inferences about what’s in the code?

**Nicholas:** Yeah. So it usually is just looking at code to like an annoying
degree where like, I’m, I’m sure that someone could come up with like a
better prompting thing that like would like have it use the tools more, you
know? Okay. A thing that it has a really hard time with is running GDB
interactively. Huh. The harness is just not set up, the Cloud Code Harness,
the Codex Harness, because it has to launch the program and send keys to it,
which is just not exactly how the harness is set up. And so what you’ll find
when it does is instead it runs GDB and just reruns the program from init,
passing the sequence of commands that it wants, and then it runs and hits the
breakpoint and stops. And then it reruns the whole command again and just
adds on the next step. Which is like a terribly inefficient way of doing the
thing.

**David:** Quadratic GDP.

**Nicholas:** Yeah, exactly. But like, you know, like it’s like sometimes
like they’re just like not very good and like they do these dumb
stuff. Sometimes it would be generally better if they did more of this. But
like, yeah, again, we could do more to improve the harnesses.

**Thomas:** They are smart enough to go through the Git logs and see if there
were previous vulnerabilities and then generalize from the
vulnerabilities. Yes.

**Nicholas:** Yes. They do, they do this too. Yes.

**Deirdre:** They’re also dumb enough when I’m like in a fresh context to be
like, revert the thing you just did. They’re like, okay, I will go to a
previous Git commit. I’m like, there is no previous Git commit.

**David:** Commit.

**Deirdre:** Shut up, robot.

**Nicholas:** Yeah.

**Thomas:** What’s, so like while you’re on the topic of like 4.5 and
harnesses and all that, like what changed 4.5 to 4.6? Like, is there like,
was it like a step function there for you or like?

**Nicholas:** I think 4.5 was the big step function for me where 4.5 really
gave some intelligence in the model. I don’t know what you want to call it. I
hate using the word, but just soul, spirit, humanity, essence. The model just
started to get a lot better. That was really the big one. 4.6 again just made
it even better. OpenAI saw the same thing with 5.2 was just like a big step
increase. And 5.4, again, people have found is quite a bit better. And I
don’t actually understand a lot of why the models get better. I don’t know, I
have enough things to be doing, sort of playing with them. But someone just
says, here is a new model checkpoint, please play with it. And I’m like,
okay. And then I go do my things. Scaling works, which is like a, unfortunate
thing that I didn’t want to believe, but empirically has turned out to be
true. And for the foreseeable future, it appears like it’s going to remain
true.

**Thomas:** It’s terrible, right?

**David:** It’s a really bitter lesson to learn.

**Thomas:** Yeah, I was going to say, it’s terrible. It actually is terrible,
right? Because all of the fun problems are gone. You just have to sit there
and wait for them to come up with a new model. I hate it.

**Nicholas:** I mean, this is a real sort of question. Yeah.

**David:** The fun problems are not. Gone. ‘Cause like, well, now we have two
different problems. The two obvious like follow-ups for like, okay, the
models are really good at finding bugs now, are the models really good at
exploiting bugs? Have you had Claude write exploits or is that like too woke
for Anthropic? And then step two is like, could you maybe try patching some
of them?

**Nicholas:** Yeah.

**Thomas:** Okay.

**Nicholas:** Yeah. So, okay. So let me talk about each of them in turn. So
exploits, it’s getting better. It’s like not yet excellent at exploits. In
the Firefox case, we had a separate blog post on the Anthropic blog where one
out of, I think maybe two out of 500 times, it was able to produce a
JavaScript exploit that was able to— So the bug was some heap thing. What the
model was able to do was it was not a heap spray, but it allocated some other
object on some other memory, overwrote the function pointer to point to some
other thing, and then called and it was like, I don’t know, some 10-chain
deep thing that eventually got at some point that I could then call out and
go write some stuff. It was able to do this some of the time. I think a human
could definitely do that much better, much faster today. But 4.6 was the
first model we saw any sign of life on the exploitation. So yes, I would like
to measure this. It’s not clear to me I want to make the model better at
this, but I would like to measure this to keep track of it because The trend
has been first you don’t do it at all.

**Thomas:** If you don’t do it, our overseas enemies will with their open
weights models.

**Nicholas:** I mean, yes, there are many reasons why I want to keep track of
what the current capabilities are. But yeah, I definitely do think that you
can’t bury your head in the sand. The capability frontier is advancing. The
best that I can do is to like measure what is true and then just like talk
very loudly and say like, please be aware of the following fact about the
world now. You know, like it was nice when, you know, we didn’t know about
Spectre. Like that was just like a nice world to live in, you know, like, but
like too bad, like it turns out a true fact about the world is you can do
side channels and you can have these CPUs and like, you know, like now
everything is worse, but like that’s just like the world we live in. Same
thing with like, you know, ROP. Like, wouldn’t it be nice if write or execute
was like, you know, just the perfect solution? But like, it’s like not, like,
it’s just like, here is a true fact about the world. Like, you can do this
thing. Now we have like this other thing that is true in the world. We have
these language models that can find these bugs and potentially soon exploit
them. And maybe we wish that like we didn’t have these things, but like, you
know, they exist and we should like measure the capabilities that they have
so that like we’re not just blind to what happens.

**Thomas:** I know that you’re like, I know that you’re, I know that you’re
not like, you don’t speak for Anthropic, let alone for OpenAI, but like my
understanding of the OpenAI situation is that if you want to use Codex to
find vulnerabilities, that there’s some program you sign up for to do that,
right? If I wanted to replicate the kind of things that you are doing right
now with just my Claude subscription, can I just do that and it’ll work?

**Nicholas:** Yeah, we use the production model API and run the things that
we have been doing. So like, you know, I have like the exact set of weights
that, I am using or the set of weights that you have access to run. I think
there are, okay, there’s a question of scale. At some point in the last
couple months I’ve spent lots of money on doing some of this. So some of that
is how much you’re willing to pay.

**Thomas:** There was like, there used to, I don’t know, you’re young, but
you may remember there used to be a thing called Folding@home where people
had like, right. So people had computers that were sitting there doing
nothing and you could harness them to do stuff. And now people have these gym
subscriptions to cloud where I have the Claude 20x Max or whatever, but I’m
really only using a tiny amount of my tokens. So like if I built the thing
that just like took everybody’s spare quota for their tokens and then used it
to like find vulnerabilities in open source code, you guys would be fine with
that. And hold on, I said you guys, I didn’t mean to say you guys, I meant
you, Nicholas Carlini, would be okay with that.

**Deirdre:** Pretty sure that would be a violation of terms of service and
the spamming of the tokens and the account subscription. And it wouldn’t have
anything to do with the use of the, use of the time.

**Thomas:** I can’t, I can’t get over the fact that like the input to this
whole thing is just like you, you find a target like Ghost and you check it
out in a Docker container and then like you write a bash loop around like all
the files in that thing and like a dumb, no offense to the quality of your
prompts.

**Deirdre:** Production Claude Opus 4.6.

**Thomas:** We should all, we have another one of these that we’re going to
record relatively soon and the three of us should come back to that having
done this and found a bunch of vulnerabilities. It seems like really easy to
go try and do this and find vulnerabilities. It’s weird to me that I’m not
finding, yeah, it’s weird to me that I’m not finding vulnerabilities right
now. We should have opened the podcast by starting to like look for one.

**Deirdre:** Should we just click the button?

**David:** Well, I guess we’ll have to have fun staying poor because we’re
not submitting to bug bounties with all of the bugs that Claude found. But
like the flip side of that question is like, well, why aren’t these fucking
projects running it themselves? Right? Like I say, as somebody who has to
deal with bug bounties a lot.

**Nicholas:** Fault. Yeah. Right. Like, I feel bad, like, you know, blaming,
like, you know, like the open source developers did nothing
wrong. Right. Like, like they put something out there in the world that like
is like trying to be good and nice for everyone. And I’m like, you know,
along comes this like, you know, bug hunting machine and like, you know, like
it’s like, I don’t know, I quite bad saying like, you know, it’s like their,
their fault in some sense.

**David:** Yeah, absolutely.

**Nicholas:** But like, you know, I do think that like people should spend
more time doing this. Maybe this brings us to the patching question that you
which is that like, you know, we, we, yeah, we have been trying quite hard to
do this. You know, Anthropic now has this tool called Claude Code Security,
which is this like patched proposal thing. DeepMind has this CodeMender
thing. OpenAI has Aardvark, I think they’re calling their thing. Like there’s
like a lot of people who are trying to do this. And I think this is like
very, very useful and very important too. It’s just the case that it’s harder
to automatically patch than it is to automatically find bugs. And what you
really don’t want to do is you don’t want to propose like, you know, hello, I
am here to help. Here are, you know, 500 PRs that I promise fix bugs. Please
review them all. Like you’re like, you’re, you’re not, you’re like, the
developer’s gonna have to spend almost as much time reviewing the correctness
of these PRs as they’re going to have to spend as if they had patched them
themselves, more or less. They’re gonna reject a bunch of them because
because the model put it in an entirely reasonable point, but it’s just not
aesthetically where the developer wanted to put it in the first place. And
they care about the quality of their code so that they understand where
things are. And there are a bunch of difficulties here with patching that
just are not present when I’m just throwing wrenches and finding bugs. It’s a
much harder question to try and do this patching thing. I’m glad that all of
the 3 companies are trying quite hard to have a product that will do
this. And like are proposing tools that will, you know, find as, as do, do as
good of a job as we can given the current capabilities of the models. It’s
just like, it’s so much harder to do. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

**David:** So it seems like there’s like a kind of two ways that we can go
from here is like we, we could be in like a local minimum where it is now,
it’s like really easy to find bugs and then, but it’s not like super easy to
patch them. But like once, you know, the next iteration of models comes out
out, then they’ll be able to patch all the bugs. They’ll like, the model’s
fine. And we just have to like suck it up in the meantime. Another one could
just be like, well, no, now there’s just like more bugs everywhere. And like,
I don’t know, maybe we get marginally, you know, better patching them, but
the rate of bugs is coming faster. And then the variant of that one is like—

**Deirdre:** We can see them now. They were there. We can just see them now.

**David:** You can see more of them. And it’s like, I haven’t talked to a
single person that thinks that we can like exhaustively enumerate all of the
bugs.

**Nicholas:** Bugs.

**Deirdre:** Yeah.

**David:** That, that like, especially in, in a large codebase, like a
browser, like at some point, like you, you just end up in this like
metastable state where fixing the bugs introduces new bugs and you just kind
of like, um, have jobs.

**Nicholas:** I’m actually pretty optimistic here about like not introducing
so many new bugs because like you can imagine a world where like most code
that gets committed gets reviewed by one of these bug hunting things and
like, it’s not gonna be perfect, but like, I do think that we can reduce the
number of bugs that are inserted into code. By like doing a code review on,
on newly inserted patches. It’s not gonna be perfect, but I think, I don’t
know, like we can, like, so, so a big part of the problem when you’re doing
this bug hunting with models is like finding ways to efficiently like burn
tokens.

**Thomas:** Yeah.

**Nicholas:** And having it like, one thing that you can very efficiently do
that like there’s a lot of tokens you can burn is by reviewing commits. So
you could like, yeah, burn tokens just by going over all of the commits that
you possibly can. But a big problem is, you know, it’s just like, it’s, so
there’s too many commits. It’s like very hard to actually go over all of
them. But if you have only new commits, then you can at least conceivably try
to just like make sure that we’re not inserting more new bugs than we’re
fixing. And like, I don’t know if this is something that’s gonna actually be
feasible, like over the, you know, if at scale, you know, Chrome probably
gets lots of commits. But I do think that you could reasonably cut down a
large fraction of simple bugs that people make because no one sort of checked
the first time. I don’t know what the ratio would actually be. I wouldn’t be
surprised if you could catch half of the bugs that are accidentally
reinserted by having a model re-review the code.

**Thomas:** Presumably there’s some way to index the codebase, right? You
have a context efficiency problem that you’re dealing with here, right? Which
is like those commits come in, they’re nice small scope, right? Like you can
fit ‘em in really easily and then like it has to do a search to get the rest
of the context for the code, which is gonna kind of blow up the context. And
you have all this interprocedural stuff and that’s, so you have to kind of
reason through that. But you can also like, this is like, like, like kind of
right now the standard trick that people have for handling context is just to
write things out to files, right? Mm-hmm. And then have it read in like
specific files strategically. This is more harness work, but like you can
imagine projects that wanna get better at like, you know, using LLMs to
screen for bugs, just like kind indexing their code in some way, like having
like text files to read, like, here’s the context for this kind of
vulnerability. Like here are the things to look at, like these functions need
to be safe for these kinds of inputs kind of stuff.

**Nicholas:** Yeah, definitely. I mean, yeah. Well, but right again, you
know, we have the advantage that like, I’m not paying for my tokens. Like I’m
not incentivized to like write the like harness that will give me 90% of the
efficiency at like, you know, 5% of the cost. Yeah. I think it was like, you
know, I’m, the market will do efficient market things and people will sort of
emerge with, with products that, that try and give you this. And I’m sort
hopeful that those will emerge more quickly than, than they have been.

**David:** It, it seems like the other thing that like is potentially a risk
is like, you know, right now you kind of think there’s like two broad groups
of attackers. There’s like sophisticated attackers and like unsophisticated
attackers. And unsophisticated attackers just like call your grandmother and
say that they’re Microsoft and ask her to like install an RDP server. Um, uh,
and props to my grandmother for recognizing it was a scam and unplugging her
computer. Here. Um, but, um, like, that’s like one whole side of the world is
just basically like abuse or like tricking people into installing malware and
then like writing the malware. But the way it gets on your machine is you
installed it with Minecraft by accident. And then there’s like the side of
the sophisticated attackers that are like doing exploiting memory corruption
bug. And then a lot of the effort that we spend in, in security is like on
the sophisticated attacker side. That’s like basically like 70% plus of the
bug patching. Is dealing with them, but they’re actually a very, very, very
small amount of the actual exploitation. There’s not a lot of people doing
them. You know, if you look at like the number of commits that are like known
exploited in the wild or number of CVEs in a browser that are known exploited
in the wild compared to like the number of CVEs they issue per year is very
low. Do you think that we’re at risk of like, of that becoming like that this
thing that was high-effort targeted becoming broadly adopted at scale in the
same way just tricking people into installing malware or an Internet Explorer
toolbar 20 years ago was.

**Nicholas:** Yeah. I don’t know what I’m more worried about here. I think
you should be worried. Yeah. Okay. So let me answer a question you didn’t ask
first and then I’ll come back to the question you did ask, which is, I don’t
know. It’s very, very fun to find these memory corruption things, but In
practice, most exploits are just someone forgot to patch their service and
it’s running something that’s known vulnerable or they misconfigured
something and now they left some port open or whatever. I’m very, very
worried about the ability of models to find and exploit those class of bugs
because there’s just very little that’s new there. It just needed someone to
go looking for it. The big problem that I have is I can’t measure this
because I just can’t go scanning random internet services and try and like
find stuff. But like, I am very worried that like random people will pretty
easily be able to do this. So I think this is like one form of thing that
like people will be able to do, even if they don’t know anything about memory
corruption, just like, you know, find open services and like, you know, find
things that like are just running servers that haven’t been updated since
whatever, 10 years ago. And then look at like, you just like own it. I’m also
worried, yes, about random people being able to find novel zero days. It’s
unclear to me which of these things I should be more worried about. I would
like someone to try and figure out how to measure this in some way. I don’t
feel like I have a good answer which one is the most concerning, but I do
think that we are fundamentally entering a new world on the order of having
recently discovered that you can now smash the stack. Every once in a while
you get these things, the world is different and like, you know, you’ll end
up with like, you know, 2002 to 2004, the like, you know, the wave of worms
and everything hitting was like immense. And like, I’m like kind of worried
that like we’ll have that world again where people develop software in a
world that was not, that did not like think about security as like a
first-class object. And then it turns out we widely distributed the
understanding of how to go and exploit these things. And then you end up
with, you know, whatever, every other 5 days some worm that takes down half
the internet.

**Thomas:** It is kind of an inversion of the standard concern that AI
skeptics have about this whole situation is that everyone’s writing code with
LLMs and that code is all going to be riven with vulnerabilities because the
LLMs are stupid. But the reality is is like LLMs are pretty reasonably good
at knocking down kind of standard vulnerability classes, much better than we
are, right? I think that’s probably not much in doubt, right? It’s like the
first cut an LLM has.

**Nicholas:** Yeah. These are not contradicting statements though. I think
like it can both be true that the model can write dumb code and it could be
true that, and like, it’s like I sort of talk to some people who say this and
they’re like, I agree with you. Like it would be really like, I trust
currently people to write code more than I trust the models. But also it can
be true the models are bad there and they could be good at other certain
classes of things. For example, finding vulnerabilities. I get very
frustrated when people try to deny the reality that the models are actually
good at certain things and they may not be good everywhere. There’s many
places where I wish that people didn’t use them, but we should at least be
acknowledging the things that they can do. Sorry for the small rant.

**Thomas:** No, that’s okay. But you have to disclose which thing in security
which people weren’t doing with LLMs.

**Nicholas:** It’s not necessarily insecurity. I just mean other things that,
you know, like I have gotten a number of emails from people who I know that
just have too many dashes and the word genuinely. And I’m just like, I care
to hear what you— Yes. It’s just like, yeah, I care what you have to say, not
what the model has to say on your behalf.

**Deirdre:** Do me a solid and write me an email from you, the human being.

**Nicholas:** Thanks. Yes. Right.

**Thomas:** Yeah, I gotta say, like, I’ve been pretty bearish on kind of
startups doing this stuff on like, you know, vulnerability hunting
startups. ‘Cause I figure both OpenAI and Anthropic have just like
multifactorial incentives to get really good at this. Like both for like the
good of the world and also because it answers like the chief objection people
have to building, you know, code with LLMs is it’s gonna introduce security
vulnerabilities. There’s all these reasons why all of the frontier model
companies are just naturally going to get good at this stuff. But I think you
probably got 10 or 15 different startups funded just by saying that every
time a new, a new model company introduces a new model, it finds new
vulnerabilities, which means there’s now space for everyone just to say, yes,
but we’re a multimodal, like, finding vulnerabilities startup.

**Nicholas:** No, I do think there’s good reason for companies to exist that
are doing this. You know, the costs are one of them. I do think that, like,
you know, the frontier labs are somewhat incentivized to reduce costs, but
that are maybe less incentivized than a startup might be. I do think startups
can be distributed across multiple labs. You could imagine that Model 1
proposes a bug and then Company 2 is better at auditing it and so you combine
them in clever ways. Expo actually has a nice interesting blog post from a
year ago where they Franken-modeled something where every other request that
went switched between OpenAI and Anthropic and doing this in this way was
better in some ways than either alone. I think there’s lots of interesting
things that can be done. I think there is work to be done on scaffolding the
models better. This exponential right now reminds me of the exponential from
CPU speeds going up until let’s say 2000 or something where you had these
game developers who would develop really impressive games on the current
thing of hardware and they do it by writing like really detailed intricate
x86 instruction sequences for like just exactly whatever this, like, you
know, whatever 486 can do, knowing full well that in 2 years, you know, the
pen team is gonna be able to do this much faster and they didn’t need to do
it. But like you need to do it now because you wanna sell your game today and
like, yeah, you can’t just like wait and like have everyone be able to do
this. And so I do think that there definitely is value in squeezing out all
of the last little juice that you can from the current model. Models. And the
frontier model developers companies are just not quite the same way
incentivized to do all of this. And so I think there’s plenty of room for
people to try and build stuff with these models. And I would like to see more
of it. What I just don’t want to see is people putting in work that is just
entirely wasted and late enough that the next model is just better than what
they would have done. And it was just not efficient in ways where If John
Carmack had spent 5 years writing super efficient Doom things and had
released Doom in 1997, right? It just could have run it just as efficiently
on whatever unrolled C code compared to whatever optimized assembly thing he
wrote for whatever stuff. So it’s like, right. I just think people need to be
a little careful with how they’re doing it.

**Thomas:** I’m just going to say my company pays for my subscription, so if
I come back Next time we record and I don’t have a vulnerability, you guys
should all make fun of me.

**Deirdre:** Okay. We will.

**David:** Sounds like you’re respecting shareholder value.

**Thomas:** Indeed.

**Deirdre:** Um, this is fantastic. I’m a little bit scared, but also a
little bit like excited.

**Nicholas:** So I think this is the right reaction. Like I, yeah, I’m also
quite, quite worried. I think like, you know, I think if you have played with
these things and you are not a little bit worried about what is about to
happen in the world, I think like you are not thinking critically. I think
it’s happening here first, but I think it’s going to happen in many other
areas too. It’s not obvious to me. I’m not an expert in the other subjects of
the world. I think we are seeing this first because these models happen to be
very good at coding. But I do think we should think through this very
carefully. Other people will encounter these problems next. I would like to
just have the world start thinking about these things I do think things will
look quite different in a small number of years and we should be just
spending the time that we need to understand what’s true and not just sitting
and hoping for the best.

**Deirdre:** Yeah. I mean, things have been looking very different in a
matter of months.

**Nicholas:** Yes. Yeah, no, I have to hit my mind. I want to say in small
numbers of years and I have to recalibrate to months. But yeah, things are
going very fast and I think we need to just be willing to look at it.

**Deirdre:** At the very least update our models of the world.

**Nicholas:** Yes.

**Deirdre:** Yep. Pun not intended.

**Thomas:** Nicholas, this is amazing. Thank you so much for—

**Deirdre:** Thank you.

**David:** It’s great to talk to you guys.

**Deirdre:** Hell yeah. All right, I’m stopping.

description: The article explores the evolution of cybersecurity through key figures
  and events from the 1990s. It highlights how early hackers navigated a nascent Internet,
  transforming from explorers to vital players in cybersecurity. Notable contributions
  include the formation of DEF CON and Black Hat by "The Dark Tangent," and foundational
  roles in security engineering by Heather Adkins, Jamie Butler, and Justine Bone.
  Their experiences and initiatives shaped critical security practices and tools,
  emphasizing the need for proactive vulnerability management and resilience in a
  rapidly evolving digital landscape. The preservation of their stories underscores
  the cultural and technical legacy they leave behind.

## Starting Internet Subsystem‚Ä¶

The early hacking scene grew in the hum of dial-up modems, the glow of CRT monitors, and the thrill of reaching a system on the other side of the world. In the 1990s, the World Wide Web emerged from its academic and military roots, suddenly making the Internet accessible to anyone with a computer, a phone line, and curiosity. Web browsers moved from novelty to necessity, bulletin boards and IRC channels became thriving communities, and information travelled faster than institutions could adapt.

Hackers explored this new frontier with equal measures of skill and defiance. Some pursued knowledge for its own sake, unravelling the hidden languages of systems and networks. Others exposed weaknesses in infrastructure, sometimes to make a point rather than for gain. Many quietly built the tools, code, and ideas that would shape the future of cybersecurity.

Their work forced software makers to take flaws seriously, helped popularise public vulnerability disclosure through platforms like the Bugtraq mailing list, and pushed encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems into mainstream use. The culture they created, grounded in curiosity, collaboration, and technical mastery, remains a touchstone for today‚Äôs security professionals.

This project captures that moment when the Internet was still a frontier, security was an afterthought, and one determined individual could change the story. By photographing the people who lived that era, using the technology of the time, we preserve both their image and the imperfect beauty of the medium that defined their world.

All images in this series were captured using a Sony Mavica MVC-FD8, storing each frame as a 640√ó480 pixel JPEG of approximately 68 KB on a 1.44 MB floppy disk. Post-processing was carried out on an Apple Power Mac G4, using Adobe Photoshop 5, preserving the look and limitations of the technology from the era. This process ensures that every photograph retains the texture, resolution, and tonal character of late-1990s digital imaging.

## The Dark Tangent

_The Dark Tangent_ came up in the chaotic energy of the early Internet, a time when hacking was more about exploration than profit. In 1993, he threw what was meant to be a one-off party for hackers and friends; it became DEF CON, the gathering that would define hacker culture for decades. In the late 1990s, he launched Black Hat, a place where the underground and the corporate world collided, often uncomfortably, but with results that reshaped the security industry. DT built bridges between outlaws, researchers, and suits, forcing conversations that companies and governments could no longer ignore. His work gave the hacking community a global stage and proved that the skills once dismissed as mischief were essential to defending the modern digital world.

## Heather Adkins

Heather Adkins cut her teeth in the 1990s at an ISP, where a data breach sparked something deeper than alarm. Rather than recoil, she was consumed by curiosity, how did those intruders break in, and what could she learn from their exploits? That moment set her course. By the early 2000s, she had become one of the founding architects of Google‚Äôs Security Team, forging security practices from the ground up as the company grew. Her transition from an intrigued bystander to the guardian of one of the world‚Äôs largest digital estates laid the groundwork for security-by-design at unparalleled scale. Today, as Vice President of Security Engineering, Adkins leads Google‚Äôs Office of Cybersecurity Resilience, shaping how the modern internet defends itself, an evolution that began with nothing more than a hacked ISP and a spark of curiosity.

## Jamie Butler

Jamie Butler began coding at age twelve, but cybersecurity took hold during his high school years after watching the film _Sneakers_. His professional path started at the National Security Agency, where he worked as a computer scientist, gaining insight into offensive and defensive techniques that would shape his career.

He went on to co-author the influential book _Rootkits: Subverting the Windows Kernel_, exploring how attackers could manipulate the heart of operating systems to evade detection. In industry, Butler held key roles at Mandiant and FireEye before becoming Chief Technology Officer and Chief Scientist at Endgame, where he led work on advanced detection, exploit analysis, and endpoint protection.

A respected figure in the research community, Butler has served on the Black Hat Review Board, taught courses on memory forensics and rootkit technologies, and spoken at many of the world‚Äôs leading security conferences. His work bridges deep technical knowledge with practical tools that have influenced how defenders detect and respond to advanced threats.

## Justine Bone

Justine Bone came up in the late 1990s when breaking software meant long nights, bad coffee, and a command-line prompt. At Internet Security Systems she was part of the crew finding and weaponising vulnerabilities before most companies even had a patching policy. Her background in technical research was sharpened by time inside New Zealand‚Äôs Government Communications Security Bureau, where she learned how security played out on a national stage.

She later steered security strategy in the Commercial sector, ultimately becoming CEO of Immunity Inc, a brilliant security research firm, before founding and leading MedSec, a firm that specialises in medical‚Äëdevice and healthcare cybersecurity. Today, she serves as Executive Director of the Crypto‚ÄëISAC, where she coordinates cyber‚Äëthreat intelligence sharing and resilience initiatives across the cryptocurrency industry

description: A recent NYU research project unveiled an AI-powered ransomware called
  "PromptLocker." Unlike traditional ransomware, it employs automated targeting, effectively
  selecting victims and exfiltrating sensitive data before encrypting system volumes.
  The implementation showcases the potential for AI to enhance the sophistication
  of cyberattacks. While currently a research prototype, this underscores the urgent
  need for advanced cybersecurity measures to preemptively detect and mitigate such
  AI-driven threats before they evolve into real-world applications. The implications
  for threat modeling in cybersecurity strategies are significant.

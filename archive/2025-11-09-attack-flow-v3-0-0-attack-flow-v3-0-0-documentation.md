description: Attack Flow v3.0.0 is a framework developed by MITRE for articulating
  cyber adversary tactics and techniques, enhancing defenders' understanding of operational
  dynamics. It offers structured guidance based on empirical insights from cybersecurity
  practitioners, aiming to bolster threat-informed defense strategies. Key resources
  include flow examples, a builder tool, and training materials. The project is openly
  licensed under Apache 2.0, promoting collaborative defense improvements. This tool's
  integration with MITRE ATT&CK enriches its applicability within threat modeling
  and incident response frameworks.

# Attack Flow v3.0.0 [¶](https://center-for-threat-informed-defense.github.io/attack-flow/\#attack-flow-version "Permalink to this heading")

Attack Flow is a language for describing how cyber adversaries combine and sequence
various offensive techniques to achieve their goals. The project helps defenders and
leaders understand how adversaries operate and improve their own defensive posture. This
project is created and maintained by the [MITRE Center for Threat-Informed\\
Defense](https://ctid.mitre-.org/) in futherance of our mission to advance
the state of the art and the state of the practice in threat-informed defense
globally. The project is funded by our [research participants](https://ctid.mitre.org/projects/attack-flow#participants-section). The development of these usage guides has been shaped by direct input and feedback from our members—practitioners at large, international organizations with advanced cybersecurity programs. Their real-world experience and operational insights have grounded this work in practical, applicable guidance for defenders around the world.

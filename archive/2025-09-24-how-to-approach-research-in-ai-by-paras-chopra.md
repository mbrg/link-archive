description: In a recent post on Lossfunk Letters, Paras Chopra outlines a structured
  approach for AI research targeting interns. Key insights include the necessity of
  formulating clear research questions and accompanying hypotheses before conducting
  experiments. Emphasis is placed on differentiating core experiments from peripheral
  factors to avoid conflating variables, which is crucial for deriving valid conclusions.
  This methodological framework advocates for a deliberate exploration path in AI,
  enhancing research quality and efficacy. Such an approach can lead to more meaningful
  advancements in AI methodologies.

I strongly recommend everyone to think and write

- what **research question** are you exploring

- a couple of **research hypotheses** accompanying them


Research hypothesis is your hunch about what’s true about research question.

Only once you have research hypotheses, you should **think of experiments that will prove or disprove your hypothesis.**

> Without this, you’ll simply shoot in the dark randomly which is fine for initial exploration but eventually you need to methodically explore your research question

Also, when you’re running experiments make sure you know **what’s the core experiment and what’s peripheral**. Focus on core and make simplifying assumptions about every thing else.

If you don’t do that, you’ll simply conflate multiple factors and you’d never know why something works or doesn’t work.

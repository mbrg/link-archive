description: The Wikipedia page on "Signs of AI Writing" outlines distinctive characteristics
  of text generated by AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.
  Key indicators include statistical uniformity in writing, excessive use of certain
  phrases, weak argumentation, and surfaces features like broken citations or improper
  formatting. Detection strategies emphasize nuanced assessments beyond superficial
  indications, ensuring human judgment is central to evaluating text authenticity.
  These insights highlight the need for vigilance in monitoring AI contributions,
  reflecting broader concerns about informational integrity within collaborative platforms
  like Wikipedia.

[![A screenshot of ChatGPT reading: "[header] Legacy & Interpretation [body] The "Black Hole Edition" is not just a meme — it's a celebration of grassroots car culture, where ideas are limitless and fun is more important than spec sheets. Whether powered by a rotary engine, a V8 swap, or an imagined fighter jet turbine, the Miata remains the canvas for car enthusiasts worldwide."](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/ChatGPT_response_screenshot_1.jpg/250px-ChatGPT_response_screenshot_1.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ChatGPT_response_screenshot_1.jpg) LLMs tend to have an identifiable writing style.

This is a list of writing and formatting conventions typical of [AI chatbots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_chatbot "AI chatbot") such as [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT "ChatGPT"), with real examples taken from Wikipedia articles and drafts. It is a [field guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_guide "Field guide") to help detect [undisclosed AI-generated content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:LLMDISCLOSE "Wikipedia:LLMDISCLOSE") on Wikipedia. This list is _descriptive_, not _prescriptive_; it consists of observations, not rules. Advice about formatting or language to avoid in Wikipedia articles can be found in the [policies and guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:PAG "Wikipedia:PAG") and the [Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:MOS "Wikipedia:MOS"), but does not belong on this page.

This list is _not_ a ban on certain words, phrases, or punctuation. Not all text featuring these indicators is AI-generated, as the [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model "Large language model") that power AI chatbots are trained on human writing, including the writing of Wikipedia editors. This is simply a catalog of very common patterns observed over many thousands of instances of AI-generated text, _specific to Wikipedia._ While some of its advice may be broadly applicable, some signs—particularly those involving punctuation and formatting—may not apply in a non-Wikipedia context.

The patterns here are also only potential _signs_ of a problem, not _the problem itself_. While many of these issues are immediately obvious and easy to fix—e.g., excessive boldface, poor wordsmithing, broken markup, citation style quirks—they can point to less outwardly visible problems that carry [much more serious policy risks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AIFAIL "Wikipedia:AIFAIL"). If LLM-generated text is polished enough (initially or subsequently), those surface defects might not be present, but deeper problems can be. Please do not merely treat these signs as the problems to be fixed; that could just make detection harder. The actual problems are those deeper concerns, so make sure to address them, either yourself or by flagging them, per the advice at [Wikipedia:Large language models § Handling suspected LLM-generated content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Large_language_models#Handling_suspected_LLM-generated_content "Wikipedia:Large language models") and [Wikipedia:WikiProject AI Cleanup/Guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_AI_Cleanup/Guide "Wikipedia:WikiProject AI Cleanup/Guide").

The [speedy deletion policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Speedy_deletion "Wikipedia:Speedy deletion") criterion [G15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:G15 "Wikipedia:G15") (LLM-generated pages without human review) is limited to the most objective and least contestable indications that the page's content was generated by an LLM. There are three such indicators, the first of which can be found in [§ Communication intended for the user](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Communication_intended_for_the_user) and the other two in [§ Citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Citations). The other signs are not sufficient on their own for speedy deletion.

Do not solely rely on [artificial intelligence content detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_content_detection "Artificial intelligence content detection") tools (such as [GPTZero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPTZero "GPTZero")) to evaluate whether text is [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLM "LLM")-generated. While they perform better than random chance, these tools have nontrivial error rates and cannot replace human judgment.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-Russell-1) Detectors can be brittle to multiple factors such as text modifications (e.g. paraphrasing and spacing changes) and the use of generative models not seen during detector training.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-2)

## Content

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Content")\]

[Shortcuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Shortcut "Wikipedia:Shortcut")

- [WP:AIWTW](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:AIWTW&redirect=no)[WP:AIWTW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AIWTW "Wikipedia:AIWTW")
- [WP:AI-ISM](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:AI-ISM&redirect=no)[WP:AI-ISM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AI-ISM "Wikipedia:AI-ISM")

LLMs (and [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network "Artificial neural network") in general) use statistical algorithms to guess (infer) what should come next based on a large corpus of training material. It thus tends to [regress to the mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_to_the_mean "Regression to the mean"); that is, the result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases. It can simultaneously be a strength and a "tell" for detecting AI-generated content.

For example, LLMs are usually trained on data from the internet in which famous people are generally described with positive, important-sounding language. Consequently, the LLM tends to omit specific, unusual, nuanced facts (which are statistically rare) and replace them with more generic, positive descriptions (which are statistically common). Thus the specific detail "invented the first train-coupling device" might become "a revolutionary titan of industry." It is like shouting louder and louder that a portrait shows a uniquely important person, while the portrait itself is fading from a sharp photograph into a blurry, generic sketch. The subject becomes simultaneously less specific and more exaggerated.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-3)

This statistical regression to the mean, a smoothing over of specific facts into generic statements, that could equally apply to many topics, makes AI-generated content easier to detect.

### Undue emphasis on symbolism, legacy, and importance

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Undue emphasis on symbolism, legacy, and importance")\]

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|  | Words to watch: **_stands/serves as_, _is a testament/reminder_, _plays a vital/significant/crucial/pivotal role_, _underscores/highlights its importance/significance_, _reflects broader_, _symbolizing its ongoing/enduring/lasting impact_, _key turning point_, _indelible mark_, _deeply rooted_, _profound heritage_, _steadfast dedication_, ...** |

LLM writing often puffs up the importance of the subject matter by adding statements about how arbitrary aspects of the topic represent or contribute to a broader topic.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-chronicle-4) There is a distinct and easily identifiable repertoire of ways that it writes these statements.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-Juzek-5)

> The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was officially established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics in Spain. \[...\]
>
> The founding of Idescat represented a significant shift toward regional statistical independence, enabling [Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia "Catalonia") to develop a statistical system tailored to its unique socio-economic context. This initiative was part of a broader movement across Spain to decentralize administrative functions and enhance regional governance.

> Kumba has long been an important center for trade and agriculture. \[...\] The establishment of road networks connecting Kumba to other parts of the Southwest Region, such as Mamfe and Buea, helped solidify its role as a regional hub.

— From [this revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1248482444 "Special:Diff/1248482444") to [Kumba, Cameroon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumba,_Cameroon "Kumba, Cameroon")

LLMs may include these statements for even the most mundane of subjects like etymology or population data. Sometimes, they add hedging preambles acknowledging that the subject is relatively unimportant or low-profile, before talking about its importance anyway.

**Examples**

> During the [Spanish colonial period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Colonial_Period_(Philippines) "Spanish Colonial Period (Philippines)"), the name _Bakunutan_ was hispanized to _Bacnotan_, a modification reflected in official documents preserved in the [National Archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Archives_of_the_Philippines "National Archives of the Philippines") in Manila. This etymology highlights the enduring legacy of the community's resistance and the transformative power of unity in shaping its identity.

— From [this revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1265870147 "Special:Diff/1265870147") to [Bacnotan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacnotan "Bacnotan")

> Though it saw only limited application, it contributes to the broader history of early aviation engineering and reflects the influence of French rotary designs on German manufacturers.

— From [Draft:Goebel Goe II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Goebel_Goe_II "Draft:Goebel Goe II")

When talking about biology (e.g., when asked to discuss a given animal or plant species), LLMs tend to over-emphasize species' connections to the ecosystem or environment in general, and may strain to derive such symbolism from things like taxonomy. LLMs also tend to put too much emphasis on the species' conservation status and the efforts to protect it, even if the status is unknown and no serious efforts exist, and editorialize about the importance of future research on a topic.

**Examples**

> It plays a role in the ecosystem and contributes to Hawaii's rich cultural heritage. \[...\] Preserving this endemic species is vital not only for ecological diversity but also for sustaining the cultural traditions connected to Hawaii’s native flora.

— From [this revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1262033910 "Special:Diff/1262033910") to [Nototrichium divaricatum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nototrichium_divaricatum "Nototrichium divaricatum")

> Currently, there is no specific conservation assessment for _Lethrinops lethrinus_ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, the general health of the Lake Malawi ecosystem is crucial for the survival of this and other endemic species. Factors such as overfishing, pollution, and habitat destruction could potentially impact their populations.

— From [this revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1235454313 "Special:Diff/1235454313") to [Lethrinops lethrinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethrinops_lethrinus "Lethrinops lethrinus")

### Undue emphasis on notability, attribution, and media coverage

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Undue emphasis on notability, attribution, and media coverage")\]

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|  | Words to watch: **_independent coverage_, _local/regional/national/\[country name\] media outlets_, _music/business/tech outlets_** |

Similarly, LLMs act as if the best way to prove that a subject is notable is to hit readers over the head with claims of notability, often by listing sources that a subject has been covered in. They may or may not provide additional context as to what those sources have actually said about the subject, and often inaccurately attribute their own [superficial analyses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Superficial_analyses) to the source.

Human-written press releases have of course also cited news clippings for decades, but LLMs specifically asked to write a Wikipedia article often echo the exact verbiage of [Wikipedia's guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:N "Wikipedia:N"), such as "independent coverage."

**Examples**

> She spoke about AI on CNN, and was featured in Vogue, Wired, Toronto Star, and other media.
> \[...\]
> Her insights have also been featured in \*Wired\*, \*Refinery29\*, and other prominent media outlets.

— From [this revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1276225083 "Special:Diff/1276225083") to [Sinead Bovell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinead_Bovell "Sinead Bovell") (also note the [use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Use_of_Markdown) of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown "Markdown"))

> Her views have been cited in _The New York Times_, _BBC_, _Financial Times_, and _The Hindu_.

— From [this revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1285114966 "Special:Diff/1285114966") to [Shamika Ravi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamika_Ravi "Shamika Ravi")

> Its significance is documented in archived school event programs and regional press coverage, including the \*Mesabi Daily News\*, which regularly reviewed performances held there.

— From [this revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1294930957 "Special:Diff/1294930957") to [Virginia High School (Minnesota)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_High_School_(Minnesota) "Virginia High School (Minnesota)")

On Wikipedia specifically, LLMs often painstakingly emphasize their sources in the body text—even for trivial coverage, uncontroversial facts, or other situations where a human Wikipedia editor would be more likely to either provide an inline citation or no source at all.

**Examples**

> In December 2022, [The Telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Telegraph "The Telegraph") referenced Alternative Airlines in a feature on the cheapest days to fly.

— Trivial coverage with attribution, from [Draft:Alternative Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Draft:Alternative_Airlines&action=edit&redlink=1 "Draft:Alternative Airlines (page does not exist)")

> According to filings at Companies House, the company reported annual revenue of £75.2 million in 2023 and £83 million in 2024.

— Attribution of uncontroversial information, from [Draft:Alternative Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Draft:Alternative_Airlines&action=edit&redlink=1 "Draft:Alternative Airlines (page does not exist)")

In articles about people/entities who use social media, LLMs will often note that they "maintain an active social media presence" or something similar. This wording is particularly idiosyncratic to AI text and relatively uncommon on Wikipedia before ~2024.

> The mall maintains a strong digital presence, particularly on Instagram, where it actively shares the latest updates and events. Forum Kochi has consistently demonstrated excellence in digital promotions, with high-quality, engaging, and impactful video content playing a key role in its outreach.

— From [this revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1297291381 "Special:Diff/1297291381") to [Forum Mall Kochi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum_Mall_Kochi "Forum Mall Kochi")

### Superficial analyses

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Superficial analyses")\]

[Shortcut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Shortcut "Wikipedia:Shortcut")

- [WP:SUPERFICIAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:SUPERFICIAL&redirect=no)[WP:SUPERFICIAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SUPERFICIAL "Wikipedia:SUPERFICIAL")

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|  | Words to watch: **_ensuring ..._, _highlighting ..._, _emphasizing ..._, _reflecting ..._, _underscoring ..._, _showcasing ..._, _aligns with..._, _contributing to..._** |

AI chatbots tend to insert superficial analysis of information, often in relation to its significance, recognition, or impact. This is often done by attaching a [present participle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participle#Forms "Participle") ("-ing") phrase at the end of sentences, sometimes with [vague attributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AIWEASEL "Wikipedia:AIWEASEL") to third parties (see below).[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-chronicle-4)

While [many of these words are strong AI tells on their own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AIWORDS "Wikipedia:AIWORDS"),[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-Juzek-5)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-Kobak-6) an even stronger tell is when the subjects of these verbs are facts, events, or other inanimate things. A person, for example, can highlight or emphasize something, but a fact or event cannot. The "highlighting" or "underscoring" is not something that is actually happening; it is a claim by a disembodied narrator about what something means.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-chronicle-4)

Such comments are usually [synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SYNTH "Wikipedia:SYNTH") and/or unattributed opinions in wikivoice. Newer chatbots with [retrieval-augmented generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation "Retrieval-augmented generation") (for example, an AI chatbot that can search the web) may attach these statements to [named sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Undue_emphasis_on_notability,_attribution,_and_media_coverage)—e.g., "Roger Ebert highlighted the lasting influence"—regardless of whether those sources say anything close.

> It holds a pivotal place in the [East Central Railway Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Central_Railway_Zone "East Central Railway Zone") of [Indian Railways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Railways "Indian Railways"), serving as a major railway hub with historical significance. The station has [1,676 mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_ft_6_in_gauge_railway "5 ft 6 in gauge railway") (5 ft 6 in) [broad gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_gauge "Broad gauge") along with 8 tracks and 6 platforms. \[...\] Historically, it has been crucial for linking [Darbhanga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darbhanga "Darbhanga") with significant cities like [Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi "Delhi"), [Patna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patna "Patna"), and [Kolkata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata "Kolkata"), facilitating the movement of passengers and goods. The station has supported various services, including passenger trains and express trains like the [Satyagrah Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyagrah_Express "Satyagrah Express") and [Mithila Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithila_Express "Mithila Express"), contributing to the socio-economic development of the region. Its historical role in trade and commerce, along with its position as a gateway to educational and healthcare institutions, underscores its enduring importance. Over the years, Darbhanga Junction has seen several upgrades and modernization efforts aimed at improving facilities and operational efficiency, reflecting its continued relevance in the regional and national transportation landscape.

LLMs have serious problems keeping a neutral tone, especially when writing about something that could be considered "cultural heritage"—in which case they [constantly remind the reader of its importance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Undue_emphasis_on_symbolism_and_importance).

**Examples**

In a similar way, LLM chatbots also add promotional/positive-sounding language to text about companies, business, and products, such that it sounds more like the transcript of a TV commercial.

LLMs often tell the reader about things "it's important to remember." This frequently takes the form of "disclaimers" to an imagined reader regarding safety or controversial topics, or disambiguating topics that vary in different locales/jurisdictions.

**Examples**

> The emergence of these informal groups reflects a growing recognition of the interconnected nature of urban issues and the potential for ANCs to play a role in shaping citywide policies. However, it's important to note that these caucuses operate outside the formal ANC structure and their influence on policy decisions may vary.

When generating longer outputs (such as when told to "write an article"), LLMs often add a section titled "Conclusion" or similar, and will often end a paragraph or section by summarizing and restating its core idea.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-Ju_et_al.-7)

**Examples**

> In summary, the educational and training trajectory for nurse scientists typically involves a progression from a master's degree in nursing to a Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing, followed by postdoctoral training in nursing research.

### Outline-like conclusions about challenges and future prospects

|  | Words to watch: **_Despite its... faces several challenges..._, _Despite these challenges_, _Challenges and Legacy_, _Future Outlook_ ...** |

Many LLM-generated Wikipedia articles include a "Challenges" section, which typically begins with a sentence like "Despite its \[positive/promotional words\], \[article subject\] faces challenges..." and ends with either a vaguely positive assessment of the article subject,[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-Russell-1) or speculation about how ongoing or potential initiatives could benefit the subject. Such paragraphs usually appear at the end of articles with a rigid outline structure, which may also include a separate section for "Future Prospects."

Note: This sign is about the rigid formula, not simply the mention of challenges or challenging.

**Examples**

Many studies have demonstrated that LLMs overuse certain words – especially compared to pre-2022 text, which is almost certain to be human-written.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-Juzek-5) These "AI vocabulary" words are also ubiquitous in AI-generated encyclopedias, such as [Grokipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grokipedia "Grokipedia"), and in AI-generated Wikipedia text. They often co-occur in LLM output: where there is one, there are likely others.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-Kousha-8) An edit introducing one or two of these words may not be a big deal, but an edit (post-2022) introducing lots of them, lots of times, is one of the strongest tells for AI use.

The distribution of "AI vocabulary" is slightly different depending on which chatbot or LLM was used, and has changed over time. For instance, the word _delve_ was famously overused by ChatGPT until 2025, when its incidence dropped off sharply.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-merrill-9)

Please keep context in mind. For example, while the word "underscore" is overused in AI text, it can also refer to a literal underline mark, or to [incidental music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidental_music "Incidental music").

This can take different forms, from "adjective, adjective, adjective" to "short phrase, short phrase, and short phrase".[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-Russell-1) LLMs often use this structure to make [superficial analyses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Superficial_analyses) appear more comprehensive.

Generative AI has a repetition-penalty code, meant to discourage it from reusing words too often.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-chronicle-4) For instance, the output might give a main character's name and then repeatedly use a different synonym or related term (e.g., protagonist, key player, eponymous character) when mentioning it again.

Note: If a user adds multiple pieces of AI-generated content in separate edits, this tell may not apply, as each piece of text may have been generated in isolation.

Soviet artistic constraints

Non-conformist artists

Their creativity

> Vierny, after a visit in Moscow in the early 1970’s, committed to supporting artists resisting the constraints of socialist realism and discovered Yankilevskly, among others such as Ilya Kabakov and Erik Bulatov. In the challenging climate of Soviet artistic constraints, Yankilevsky, alongside other non-conformist artists, faced obstacles in expressing their creativity freely. Dina Vierny, recognizing the immense talent and the struggle these artists endured, played a pivotal role in aiding their artistic aspirations. \[...\]

> The move to Paris facilitated an environment where Yankilevsky could further explore and exhibit his distinctive artistic vision without the constraints imposed by the Soviet regime. Dina Vierny's unwavering support and commitment to the Russian avant-garde artists played a crucial role in fostering a space where their creativity could flourish, contributing to the rich tapestry of artistic expression in the vibrant cultural landscape of Paris. Vierny's commitment culminated in the groundbreaking exhibition "Russian Avant-Garde - Moscow 1973" at her Saint-Germain-des-Prés gallery, showcasing the diverse yet united front of non-conformist artists challenging the artistic norms of their time.

When from ... to ... constructions are not used figuratively, they are used to indicate the lower and upper bounds of a scale. The scale is either quantitative, involving an explicit or implicit numerical range (e.g. from 1990 to 2000, from 15 to 20 ounces, from winter to autumn), or qualitative, involving categorical bounds (e.g. "from seed to tree", "from mild to severe", "from white belt to black belt"). The same constructions may be used to form a [merism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merism "Merism")—a figure of speech that combines the two extremes as two contrasting parts of the whole to refer to the whole. This is a figurative meaning, but it has the same structure as the non-figurative usage, because it still requires an identifiable scale: from head to toe (the length of a body denoting the whole body), [from soup to nuts](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/from_soup_to_nuts "wikt:from soup to nuts") (clearly based on time), etc. This is _not_ a false range.

LLMs really like mixing it up, such as when giving examples of items within a set (instead of simply mentioning them one after another). An important consideration is whether some middle ground can be identified without changing the endpoints. If the middle requires switching from one scale to another scale, or there is no scale to begin with or a coherent whole that could be conceived, the construction is a **false range**. LLMs often employ "figurative" (often simply: meaningless) "from ... to ..." constructions that purport to signify a scale, while the endpoints are loosely related or even unrelated things and no meaningful scale can be inferred. LLMs do this because such meaningless language is used in persuasive writing to impress and woo, and LLMs are heavily influenced by examples of persuasive writing during their training.

AI chatbots may display various phrases in [boldface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boldface "Boldface") for emphasis in an excessive, mechanical manner. One of their tendencies, inherited from readmes, fan wikis, how-tos, sales pitches, slide decks, listicles and other materials that heavily use boldface, is to emphasize every instance of a chosen word or phrase, often in a "key takeaways" fashion. Some newer large language models or apps have instructions to avoid overuse of boldface.

AI chatbots output often includes vertical lists formatted in a specific way: an ordered or unordered list where the list marker (number, bullet, dash, etc.) is followed by an inline boldfaced header, separated with a colon from the remaining descriptive text.

Instead of [proper wikitext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H:LIST "H:LIST"), a bullet point in an unordered list may appear as a bullet character (•), hyphen (-), en dash (–), [hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Use_of_Markdown) (#), [emoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Emojis), or similar character. Ordered lists (i.e. numbered lists) may use explicit numbers (such as `1.`) instead of standard wikitext. When [copied as bare text appearing on the screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SCOPY "Wikipedia:SCOPY"), some of the formatting information is lost, and line breaks may be lost as well.

While human editors and writers often like [em dashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_dash "Em dash") (—), AI _loves_ them.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-merrill-9) LLM output uses them more often than nonprofessional human-written text of the same genre, and uses them in places where humans are more likely to use commas, parentheses, colons, or (misused) hyphens (-). LLMs especially tend to use em dashes in a formulaic, pat way, often mimicking "punched up" sales-like writing by over-emphasizing clauses or parallelisms.

This sign is most useful when taken in combination with other indicators, not by itself.

**Examples**

> Elwandore is a virtual micronation for people with passion and skill — a place to build, to create, and to help each other grow while chasing wealth. But not wealth for greed — wealth to give, to help others, to donate.

### Curly quotation marks and apostrophes

AI chatbots typically use curly quotation marks (“...” or ‘...’) instead of straight quotation marks ("..." or '...'). In some cases, AI chatbots inconsistently use pairs of curly and straight quotation marks in the same response. They also tend to use the curly apostrophe (’), the same character as the curly [right single quotation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_single_quotation_mark "Right single quotation mark"), instead of the straight apostrophe ('), such as in [contractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_(grammar) "Contraction (grammar)") and [possessive forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_possessive "English possessive"). They may also do this inconsistently.

Curly quotes alone do not prove LLM use. [Microsoft Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word "Microsoft Word") as well as [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS "MacOS") and [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS "IOS") devices have a " [smart quotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_quotes "Smart quotes")" feature that converts straight quotes to curly quotes. Grammar correcting tools such as [LanguageTool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LanguageTool "LanguageTool") may also have such a feature. Curly quotation marks and apostrophes are common in professionally typeset works such as major newspapers. Citation tools like [Citer](https://citer.toolforge.org/) may repeat those that appear in the title of a web page: for example,

> McClelland, Mac (2017-09-27). ["When 'Not Guilty' Is a Life Sentence"](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/magazine/when-not-guilty-is-a-life-sentence.html). _The New York Times_. Retrieved 2025-08-03.

Note that Wikipedia allows users to [customize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:CUSTOM "Wikipedia:CUSTOM") the fonts used to display text. Some fonts display matched curly apostrophes as straight, in which case the distinction is invisible to the user.

Editors sometimes paste text from an AI chatbot that was meant as correspondence, prewriting or advice, rather than article content. This may appear in article text or within comments (<-- -->). Chatbots prompted to produce a Wikipedia article or comment may also explicitly state that the text is meant for Wikipedia, and may mention various [policies and guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:PG "Wikipedia:PG") in the output—often explicitly specifying that they're _Wikipedia_'s conventions.

A knowledge-cutoff disclaimer is a statement used by the AI chatbot to indicate that the information provided may be incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated.

If an LLM has a fixed [knowledge cutoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_cutoff "Knowledge cutoff") (usually the model's last training update), it is unable to provide any information on events or developments past that time, and it often outputs a disclaimer to remind the user of this cutoff, which usually takes the form of a statement that says the information provided is accurate only up to a certain date.

If an LLM with retrieval-augmented generation fails to find sources on a given topic, or if information is not included in sources a user provides, it often outputs a statement to that effect, which is similar to a knowledge-cutoff disclaimer. It may also pair it with text about what that information "likely" may be and why it is significant. This information is entirely [speculative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:OR "Wikipedia:OR") (including the very claim that it's "not documented") and may be based on loosely related topics or completely fabricated.

Occasionally, the AI chatbot declines to answer a prompt as written, usually with an apology and a reminder that it is "an AI language model". Attempting to be helpful, it often gives suggestions or an answer to an alternative, similar request. Outright refusals have become increasingly rare.

Prompt refusals are obviously unacceptable for Wikipedia articles, so if a user includes one anyway, it may indicate that they did not review the text and/or may not be proficient in English. Remember to [assume good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith "Wikipedia:Assume good faith"), because that editor may genuinely want to improve our coverage of [knowledge gaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Systemic_bias "Wikipedia:Systemic bias").

### Phrasal templates and placeholder text

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Phrasal templates and placeholder text")\]

AI chatbots may generate responses with fill-in-the-blank [phrasal templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrasal_template "Phrasal template") (as seen in the game _[Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs "Mad Libs")_) for the LLM user to replace with words and phrases pertaining to their use case. However, some LLM users forget to fill in those blanks. Note that non-LLM-generated templates exist for drafts and new articles, such as [Wikipedia:Artist biography article template/Preload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Artist_biography_article_template/Preload "Wikipedia:Artist biography article template/Preload") and pages in [Category:Article creation templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Article_creation_templates "Category:Article creation templates").

### Use of Markdown

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Use of Markdown")\]

- [WP:MARKDOWN](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:MARKDOWN&redirect=no)[WP:MARKDOWN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:MARKDOWN "Wikipedia:MARKDOWN")

AI chatbots are not proficient in [wikitext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H:WT "H:WT"), the [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language "Markup language") used to instruct Wikipedia's [MediaWiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki "MediaWiki") software how to format an article. As wikitext is a niche markup language, found mostly on wikis running on MediaWiki and other MediaWiki-based platforms like [Miraheze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miraheze "Miraheze"), LLMs tend to lack wikitext-formatted training data. While the corpora of chatbots did ingest millions of Wikipedia articles, these articles would not have been processed as text files containing wikitext syntax. This is compounded by the fact that most chatbots are factory-tuned to use another, conceptually similar but much more diversely applied markup language: [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown "Markdown"). Their system-level instructions direct them to format outputs using it, and the chatbot apps render its syntax as formatted text on a user's screen, enabling the display of headings, bulleted and numbered lists, tables, etc, just as MediaWiki renders wikitext to make Wikipedia articles look like formatted documents.

When asked about its "formatting guidelines", a chatbot willing to reveal some of its system-level instructions typically generates some variation of the following (this is [Microsoft Copilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Copilot "Microsoft Copilot") in mid-2025):

```
## Formatting Guidelines

- All output uses GitHub-flavored Markdown.
- Use a single main title (`#`) and clear primary subheadings (`##`).
- Keep paragraphs short (3–5 sentences, ≤150 words).
- Break large topics into labeled subsections.
- Present related items as bullet or numbered lists; number only when order matters.
- Always leave a blank line before and after each paragraph.
- Avoid bold or italic styling in body text unless explicitly requested.
- Use horizontal dividers (`---`) between major sections.
- Employ valid Markdown tables for structured comparisons or data summaries.
- Refrain from complex Unicode symbols; stick to simple characters.
- Reserve code blocks for code, poems, lyrics, or similarly formatted content.
- For mathematical expressions, use LaTeX outside of code blocks.
```

As the above suggests, Markdown's syntax is completely different from wikitext's: Markdown uses asterisks (\*) or underscores (\_) instead of single-quotes (') for bold and italic formatting, hash symbols (#) instead of equals signs (=) for section headings, parentheses (()) instead of square brackets (\[\]) around URLs, and three symbols (---, \*\*\*, or \_\_\_) instead of four hyphens (----) for thematic breaks.

Even when they are told to do so explicitly, chatbots generally struggle to generate text using syntactically correct wikitext, as their training data lead to a drastically greater affinity for and fluency in Markdown. When told to "generate an article", a chatbot typically defaults to using Markdown for the generated output, which is preserved in clipboard text by the copy functions on some chatbot platforms. If instructed to generate content for Wikipedia, the chatbot might "realize" the need to generate Wikipedia-compatible code, and might include a message like Would you like me to ... turn this into actual Wikipedia markup format (\`wikitext\`)?[\[b\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-11) in its output. If the chatbot is told to proceed, the resulting syntax is often rudimentary, syntactically incorrect, or both. The chatbot might put its attempted-wikitext content in a Markdown-style [fenced code block](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) (its syntax for [WP:PRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:PRE "Wikipedia:PRE")) surrounded by Markdown-based syntax and content, which may also be preserved by platform-specific copy-to-clipboard functions, leading to a telling footprint of both markup languages' syntax. This might include the appearance of three backticks in the text, such as: ``````wikitext```.[\[c\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-12)

The presence of faulty wikitext syntax mixed with Markdown syntax is a strong indicator that content is LLM-generated, especially if in the form of a fenced Markdown code block. However, Markdown _alone_ is not such a strong indicator. Software developers, researchers, technical writers, and experienced internet users frequently use Markdown in tools like [Obsidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_(software) "Obsidian (software)") and [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub_Flavored_Markdown "GitHub Flavored Markdown"), and on platforms like [Reddit](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043033952-Formatting-Guide), [Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline), and [Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages). Some writing tools and apps, such as [iOS Notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_Notes "IOS Notes"), [Google Docs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs "Google Docs"), and [Windows Notepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Notepad "Windows Notepad"), support Markdown editing or exporting. The increasing ubiquity of Markdown may also lead new editors to expect or assume Wikipedia to support Markdown by default.

### Broken wikitext

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: Broken wikitext")\]

Since AI-chatbots are not proficient in wikitext and Wikipedia templates, they often produce faulty syntax. A noteworthy instance is garbled code related to [Template:AfC submission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:AfC_submission "Template:AfC submission"), as new editors might ask a chatbot how to submit their [Articles for Creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_Creation "Wikipedia:Articles for Creation") draft; see [this discussion among AfC reviewers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/1299830745#Messed_up_templates "Special:PermanentLink/1299830745").

**Examples**

Note the badly malformed category link which appears to be a result of code that provides day information in the LLM's Markdown parser:

### turn0search0

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=34 "Edit section: turn0search0")\]

ChatGPT may include `citeturn0search0` (surrounded by Unicode points in the [Private Use Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Area "Private Use Area")) at the ends of sentences, with the number after "search" increasing as the text progresses. These are places where the chatbot links to an external site, but a human pasting the conversation into Wikipedia has that link converted into placeholder code. This was first observed in February 2025.

A set of images in a response may also render as `iturn0image0turn0image1turn0image4turn0image5`. Rarely, other markup of a similar style, such as `citeturn0news0` ( [example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/1276934509 "Special:PermanentLink/1276934509")), `citeturn1file0` ( [example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/1286349902 "Special:PermanentLink/1286349902")), or `citegenerated-reference-identifier` ( [example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/1276907078 "Special:PermanentLink/1276907078")), may appear.

LLMs may hallucinate non-existent categories, sometimes for generic concepts that _seem like_ plausible category titles (or [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization "Search engine optimization") keywords), and sometimes because their training set includes obsolete and renamed categories. These will appear as [red links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:REDNOT "Wikipedia:REDNOT"). You may also find category redirects, such as the longtime spammer favorite [Category:Entrepreneurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Entrepreneurs "Category:Entrepreneurs"). Sometimes, broken categories may be deleted by reviewers, so if you suspect a page may be LLM-generated, it may be worth checking earlier revisions.

Pay attention to blue links under [see also](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:See_also "Wikipedia:See also") headers as well. LLM-generated "see also" sections often tend to fill them up (to at least three links) seemingly out of obligation. If a new page/draft on some startup links to a broad term like [Financial technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology "Financial technology") in its see-also section, that's a bit suspicious.

Of course, none of this section should be treated as a hard-and-fast rule. New users are unlikely to know about Wikipedia's style guidelines for these sections, and returning editors may be used to old categories that have since been deleted.

**Examples**

> ```

### Broken external links

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=41 "Edit section: Broken external links")\]

If a new article or draft has multiple citations with external links, and several of them are broken (e.g., returning [404 errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/404_error "404 error")), this is a strong sign of an AI-generated page, particularly if the dead links are not found in website archiving sites like [Internet Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive "Internet Archive") or [Archive Today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive_Today "Archive Today"). Most links [become broken over time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot "Link rot"), but these factors make it unlikely that the link was ever real.

### Invalid DOI and ISBNs

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=42 "Edit section: Invalid DOI and ISBNs")\]

For non-AI-specific guidance about DOI and ISBNs, see [Wikipedia:DOI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:DOI "Wikipedia:DOI") and [Wikipedia:ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ISBN "Wikipedia:ISBN").

A [checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum "Checksum") can be used to verify [ISBNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN "ISBN"). An invalid checksum is a very likely sign that an ISBN is incorrect, and citation templates display [a warning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:CS1_errors#bad_isbn "Help:CS1 errors") if so. Similarly, [DOIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier "Digital object identifier") are more resistant to link rot than regular hyperlinks. Unresolvable DOIs and invalid ISBNs can be indicators of [hallucinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(AI) "Hallucination (AI)") references.

Related are DOIs that point to entirely unrelated articles and general book citations without pages. This passage, for example, was generated by ChatGPT.

> Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in the field of electrical engineering and physics that states the current passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, provided the temperature remains constant. Mathematically, it is expressed as V=IR, where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance. The law was formulated by German physicist Georg Simon Ohm in 1827, and it serves as a cornerstone in the analysis and design of electrical circuits \[1\]. Ohm’s Law applies to many materials and components that are "ohmic," meaning their resistance remains constant regardless of the applied voltage or current. However, it does not hold for non-linear devices like diodes or transistors \[2\]\[3\].

Fortescue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_LeGeyt_Fortescue "Charles LeGeyt Fortescue") was dead for 30+ years at the purported time of writing, and [Vol 55, Issue 11](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31102&punumber=5) does not list any articles that match anything remotely close to the information given in reference 3.

| Sam Beres (born June 14, 1996) — better known online as Sambucha — is an American content creator and YouTuber. <br>socialstarage.com<br>+2<br>Wikitia<br>+2<br>```<br>He is reported to have been born in New Jersey, United States, and grew up alongside three sisters. <br>```<br>Wikitubia<br>+1<br>```<br>During his youth he attended school in New Jersey and later relocated to New York City to study at university. According to available information, he studied finance and management before pursuing content creation full-time. <br>```<br>socialstarage.com<br>+1<br>Prior to his YouTube breakout, Sambucha worked in the finance sector (reportedly on Wall Street) and also experimented with other social platforms including Twitch and TikTok. <br>Wikitia<br>+1<br>```<br>His formative years and education appear to have contributed to his interest in geography and data-driven content, as he himself has remarked that exposure to diverse cultures while studying in New York helped inform his later online work. <br>```<br>Wikitubia<br>Channel launch and growth<br>Sambucha created his primary YouTube channel under the handle “@Sambucha” on January 1, 2020. <br>Wikitubia<br>+1<br>```<br>His first publicly noted video is listed as “Wikipedia Speedrun,” posted on January 22, 2021. <br>```<br>Wikitia<br>+1<br>His early content combined short-form videos (particularly YouTube Shorts) with longer-form uploads. His Shorts often comprised reaction segments, “underrated vs overrated” debates, quick facts about countries or societies, and pop-culture commentary. <br>Wikitubia<br>+1<br>```<br>Meanwhile, his longer videos included gaming (notably the online game GeoGuessr), reaction and challenge content, and what he terms “Wikipedia speedruns.” <br>```<br>Wikitia<br>+1<br>According to analytics, Sambucha’s channel saw rapid growth: by some accounts, it reached 1 million subscribers within 2021. <br>Wikitia<br>+1<br>```<br>As of recent publicly available data, his channel has over 11 million subscribers and around 18 billion + lifetime views. <br>```<br>Social Blade<br>+1<br>Content style and thematic focus<br>Sambucha’s style blends data-driven commentary, internet culture reaction, challenge formats, and gaming. His Shorts often take the form “Would you rather…?”, “This is underrated/overrated,” “Stats about countries you didn’t know” and the like. <br>Wikitubia<br>+1<br>```<br>His longer form videos have featured him playing GeoGuessr, doing “live until someone recognizes me” streams, exploring retail or product experiments, and other challenge-based formats.<br>```<br>A recurring comedic motif in his community is the “Sam is the type of guy to…” comment chain, used by viewers to satirically highlight quirks or statements from his videos. <br>Wikitubia<br>```<br>He also occasionally incorporates his academic or geographic background into videos (for example, using country stats or map-based gameplay) though these are less central than the reaction/challenge components.<br>```<br>His uploads are frequent: various sources note he posts multiple Shorts per day alongside semi-regular longer videos — a cadence that supports his large output and broad reach. <br>Reddit<br>+1<br>Achievements and recognition<br>Sambucha has achieved significant milestones in the creator space:<br>Winner of the “Dual-Format Creator of the Year” award from the Shorty Awards, recognizing his ability to perform across both short-form and long-form video formats. <br>Shorty Awards<br>Tens of millions of subscribers and billions of total video views, establishing him as a major figure among YouTube creators. <br>Social Blade<br>+1<br>A dedicated community and recognizable brand identity, particularly among younger viewers who consume Shorts and fast-paced content.<br>Other channels and platforms<br>In addition to his main YouTube channel, Sambucha has created multiple secondary channels and handles:<br>A second channel under the name “Sam2cha”, launched May 3, 2021, initially intended for longer-form uploads. <br>Wikitubia<br>+1<br>Other smaller channels and language-variant spin-offs (for example, a Spanish-language version of his brand) though these have more modest reach. <br>Famous Birthdays<br>+1<br>Active presence on platforms such as Instagram (@sambuchalul) and Twitter/X (@sambucha). <br>Wikitubia<br>Personal life<br>While Sambucha maintains a degree of privacy, publicly reported information includes:<br>He resides in New Jersey (having previously lived in New York City for approximately six years). <br>Wikitia<br>He is engaged (as of June 2024) and has referenced his fiancée in his long-form video content. <br>socialstarage.com<br>+1<br>He owns a cocker spaniel named Bruno. <br>Wikitubia<br>He has stated faith as a Christian, with Catholic-denomination references. <br>Wikitubia<br>Community reception and critique<br>The community reception to Sambucha has been largely positive in terms of growth and viewership, though some critique exists:<br>“He’s achieved most of his subscriber count from his shorts… I find his buying stuff off Temu/TikTok Shop videos entertaining … but it gets repetitive if done too much.”<br>Reddit<br>“It’s absolutely insane how much he uploads. They are all high quality, well edited videos and all released within a few days of each other. I just find it insane, props to him.”<br>Reddit<br>Some viewers argue that his content has shifted over time toward more product-testing and fewer gaming/experiment videos, and that his personality can come across as more muted compared to creators with more overt “on-camera charisma.” <br>Reddit<br>+1 |

In the below example, note the incorrect attempt at re-using references. The tool used here was not capable of searching for non-confabulated sources (as it was done the day before Bing Deep Search launched) but nonetheless found one real reference. The syntax for re-using the references was incorrect.

In this case, the _Smith, R. J._ source – being the "third source" the tool presumably generated the link ' [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3'](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3') (which has a PMID reference of 3) – is also completely irrelevant to the body of the article. The user did not check the reference before they converted it to a {{ [cite journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Cite_journal "Template:Cite journal")}} reference, even though the links resolve.

The LLM in this case has diligently included the incorrect re-use syntax after every single full stop.

### utm\_source=

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=44 "Edit section: utm_source=")\]

ChatGPT may add the [UTM parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameter "UTM parameter")`utm_source=openai` or, in edits prior to August 2025, `utm_source=chatgpt.com` to URLs that it is using as sources. Other LLMs, such as Gemini or Claude, use UTM parameters less often.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-14)

Note: While this does definitively prove ChatGPT's involvement, it doesn't prove, on its own, that ChatGPT also generated the writing. Some editors use AI tools to find citations for existing text; this will be apparent in the edit history.

## Miscellaneous

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=48 "Edit section: Miscellaneous")\]

### Abrupt cut offs

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=49 "Edit section: Abrupt cut offs")\]

AI tools may abruptly stop generating content, for example if they predict the end of text sequence (appearing as <\|endoftext\|>) next. Also, the number of tokens that a single response has is usually limited, and further responses require the user to select "continue generating".

This method is not foolproof, as a malformed copy/paste from one's local computer can also cause this. It may also indicate a [copyright violation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyvio "Wikipedia:Copyvio") rather than the use of an LLM.

### Discrepancies in writing style and variety of English

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=50 "Edit section: Discrepancies in writing style and variety of English")\]

A sudden shift in an editor's writing style, such as unexpectedly flawless grammar compared to their other communication, may indicate the use of AI tools.

Another discrepancy is a mismatch of user location, national ties of the topic to a variety of English, and the variety of English used. A human writer from India writing about an Indian university would probably not use American English; however, LLM outputs use American English by default, unless prompted otherwise.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-Ju_et_al.-7) Note that non-native English speakers tend to mix up English varieties, and such signs should raise suspicion only if there is a sudden and complete shift in an editor's English variety use.

### Age of text relative to ChatGPT launch

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=51 "Edit section: Age of text relative to ChatGPT launch")\]

ChatGPT was launched to the public on November 30, 2022. Although OpenAI had similarly powerful LLMs before then, they were paid services and not easily accessible or known to lay people. ChatGPT experienced extreme growth immediately on launch.

It is very unlikely that any particular text added to Wikipedia **prior to November 30, 2022** was generated by an LLM. If an edit was made before this date, AI use can be safely ruled out for that revision. While some older text may display some of the AI signs given in this list, and even convincingly appear to have been AI generated, the vastness of Wikipedia allows for these rare coincidences.

### Overwhelmingly verbose edit summaries

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=52 "Edit section: Overwhelmingly verbose edit summaries")\]

AI-generated [edit summaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Edit_summary "Help:Edit summary") are often unusually long, written as formal, first-person paragraphs without [abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_summary_legend "Wikipedia:Edit summary legend"), and/or conspicuously itemize Wikipedia's conventions.

### "Submission statements" in AFC drafts

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=53 "Edit section: \"Submission statements\" in AFC drafts")\]

This one is specific to drafts submitted by [Articles for Creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AFC "Wikipedia:AFC"). At least one LLM tends to insert "submission statements" supposedly intended for reviewers that supposedly explain why the subject is notable and why the draft meets Wikipedia guidelines. Of course, [all this actually does is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:BOOMERANG "Wikipedia:BOOMERANG") let reviewers know that the draft is LLM-generated, and should be declined or speedied without a second thought.

> Reviewer note (for AfC): This draft is a neutral and well-sourced biography of Portuguese public manager Jorge Patrão. All references are from independent, reliable sources (Público, Diário de Notícias, Jornal de Negócios, RTP, O Interior, Agência Lusa) covering his public career and cultural activity. It meets WP:RS and WP:BLP standards and demonstrates clear notability per WP:NBIO through: – Presidency of Serra da Estrela Tourism Region (1998–2013); – Presidency of Parkurbis – Covilhã Science and Technology Park; – Founding role in Rede de Judiarias de Portugal (member of the Council of Europe’s European Routes of Jewish Heritage); – Authorship of the book "1677 – A Fábrica d’El-Rei"; – Founder/curator of the Beatriz de Luna Art Collection (Old Master focus).

### Pre-declined AFC review templates

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=54 "Edit section: Pre-declined AFC review templates")\]

Occasionally a new editor creates a draft that includes an [AFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AFC "Wikipedia:AFC") review template already set to "declined". The template is also devoid of content with no reviewer reasoning given. The LLM apparently offers to add an AFC submission template to the draft, and then provides something like `{{AfC submission|d}}`, in which the "d" parameter pre-declines the draft by substituting {{ [AfC submission/declined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:AfC_submission/declined "Template:AfC submission/declined")}}. The draft's contribution history reveals that this template was inserted at some point by the draft's creator. Invariably the creator then asks on [Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Help desk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Articles_for_creation/Help_desk "Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Help desk") or one of the other help pages why the draft was declined with no feedback. The presence of a content-free "submission declined" header is a **strong** indicator that the draft was LLM-generated.

## Ineffective indicators

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=55 "Edit section: Ineffective indicators")\]

False accusations of AI use can [drive away new editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:BITE "Wikipedia:BITE") and foster an atmosphere of suspicion. Before claiming AI was used, consider if [Dunning–Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect "Dunning–Kruger effect") and [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias "Confirmation bias") is clouding your judgement. Here are several somewhat commonly used indicators that are ineffective in LLM detection—and may even indicate the opposite.

- **Perfect grammar**: While modern LLMs are known for their high grammatical proficiency, many editors are also skilled writers or come from professional writing backgrounds. (See also [§ Discrepancies in writing style and variety of English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Discrepancies_in_writing_style_and_variety_of_English).)

- **"Bland" or "robotic" prose**: By default, modern LLMs tend toward effusive and verbose prose, as detailed above; while this tendency is formulaic, it may not scan as "robotic" to those unfamiliar with AI writing.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-jalt-15)

- **"Fancy," "academic," or unusual words**: While LLMs disproportionately favor certain words and phrases, many of which are long and have difficult [readability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability "Readability") scores, the correlation does not extend to _all_ "fancy," academic, or "advanced"-sounding prose.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-Russell-1) Low-frequency and "unusual" words are also less likely to show up in AI-generated writing as they are statistically less common, unless they are proper nouns directly related to the topic.

[Shortcut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Shortcut "Wikipedia:Shortcut")

- [WP:AILETTER](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:AILETTER&redirect=no)[WP:AILETTER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AILETTER "Wikipedia:AILETTER")

- **Letter-like writing (in isolation)**: Although many talk page messages written with [salutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salutation "Salutation"), [valedictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valediction "Valediction") and other formalities after 2023 tend to appear AI-generated, that is not guaranteed to be the case for all such messages. Letters and emails have conventionally been written in similar ways _long_ before modern LLMs existed. An AI-generated message may start with a [subject line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SUBJECTLINE "Wikipedia:SUBJECTLINE"), include a [vertical list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Inline-header_vertical_lists)[\[d\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-16) or one or more [placeholders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Phrasal_templates_and_placeholder_text), or [end abruptly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Abrupt_cut_offs). In addition, some human editors may mistakenly post emails, letters, petitions, or messages intended for the article's subject, frequently formatted as letters.[\[e\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#cite_note-17) While such edits are generally off-topic and may be removed per the guidelines at [WP:NOTFORUM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTFORUM "Wikipedia:NOTFORUM")—particularly if they contain personal information—they are not necessarily LLM-generated.

- **Conjunctions (in isolation)**: While LLMs tend to overuse [connecting words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(linguistics) "Transition (linguistics)") and phrases in a stilted, formulaic way that implies inappropriate [synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SYNTH "Wikipedia:SYNTH") of facts, such uses are typical of essay-like writing by humans and are not strong indicators by themselves.

- **Bizarre [wikitext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext "Help:Wikitext")**: While LLMs may hallucinate templates or generate wikitext code with invalid syntax for reasons explained in [§ Use of Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Use_of_Markdown), they are not likely to generate content with certain random-seeming, "inexplicable" errors and artifacts (excluding the ones listed on this page in [§ Markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Markup)). Bizarrely placed [HTML tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_tags "HTML tags") like <span> are more indicative of poorly programmed browser extensions or a known bug with Wikipedia's content translation tool ( [T113137](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T113137 "phabricator:T113137")). Misplaced syntax like `''Catch-22 i''s a satirical novel.` (rendered as " _Catch-22 i_ s a satirical novel.") are more indicative of mistakes in [VisualEditor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:VisualEditor "Wikipedia:VisualEditor"), where such errors are harder to notice than in [source editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Source_editing "Wikipedia:Source editing").

description: OpenAI and other tech leaders are advancing AI agent security amidst
  growing risks, emphasizing iterative deployment and rigorous safety measures. OpenAI's
  ChatGPT Agent utilizes fine-tuning against prompt injection, user confirmation dialogues,
  and sandboxing. In contrast, Google DeepMind and Meta are enhancing their systems
  through automatic red teaming and prompt injection classifiers. However, fully autonomous
  agents remain aspirational, with Waymo's approach to urban driving serving as a
  model. Key takeaways include ensuring human oversight, employing redundancy, and
  leveraging continuous feedback to enhance reliability and safety in AI agent functions.

It took self-driving cars a decade to get from semi-autonomous demos to products that riders and the public entrust not to kill them, crash into them, or run them over. How long will it take for the insecure UI agents of today to achieve a level of reliability that allows us to trust them to manage our lives and businesses as assistants and colleagues?

## **ChatGPT Agent as an anchor**

ChatGPT Agent, launched last week, provides a good way to think about this, as it‚Äôs currently the most advanced software agent. [Sam Altman said this about its safety and reliability issues](https://x.com/sama/status/1945900345378697650):

> _Agent represents a new level of capability for AI systems and can accomplish some remarkable, complex tasks for you using its own computer ‚Ä¶ we showed a demo in our launch of preparing for a friend's wedding: buying an outfit, booking travel, choosing a gift, etc. ‚Ä¶ Although the utility is significant, so are the potential risks._
>
> _We have built a lot of safeguards and warnings into it, and broader mitigations than we've ever developed before from robust training to system safeguards to user controls, but we can't anticipate everything. In the spirit of iterative deployment, we are going to warn users heavily and give users freedom to take actions carefully if they want to._
>
> _I would explain this to my own family as cutting edge and experimental; a chance to try the future, but not something I'd yet use for high-stakes uses or with a lot of personal information until we have a chance to study and improve it in the wild._
>
> _We don't know exactly what the impacts are going to be, but bad actors may try to "trick" users' AI agents into giving private information they shouldn't and take actions they shouldn't, in ways we can't predict. We recommend giving agents the minimum access required to complete a task to reduce privacy and security risks._
>
> _For example, I can give Agent access to my calendar to find a time that works for a group dinner. But I don't need to give it any access if I'm just asking it to buy me some clothes._
>
> _There is more risk in tasks like "Look at my emails that came in overnight and do whatever you need to do to address them, don't ask any follow up questions". This could lead to untrusted content from a malicious email tricking the model into leaking your data._

## **What safety and reliability work did OpenAI do?**

From the [ChatGPT Agent system card](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/839e66fc-602c-48bf-81d3-b21eacc3459d/chatgpt_agent_system_card.pdf), OpenAI did the following:

- **Fine-tuned their model to resist prompt injection.** The model is subjected to "training designed to mitigate the risk of prompt injection attacks" using adversarial data combining synthetic adversarial examples and manual red-team data.

- **Built a detection and response operation on the OpenAI side.** Engineers shipped "multiple automated monitors and filters" that can be "rapidly updated ‚Ä¶ with information about new attacks."

- **Implemented user confirmation dialogues.** Before executing a web request, shell command, purchase, or email, the agent "will pause and ask the user to confirm," allowing a person to veto or correct the plan (although knowing that user confirmation is needed is likely dependent on the not-perfectly-reliable model detecting this condition).

- **Built triggers so the user has to babysit the agent as it performs sensitive actions (which they call 'Watch Mode').** When the visual browser is logged into sensitive services, the system "automatically pauses execution when the user becomes inactive or navigates away," forcing supervision to resume.

- **Built sandboxing / least privilege.** OpenAI says that ‚Äúat launch‚Äù network calls issued from the terminal available to Agent in its VM are limited to safe GET traffic, and, to reduce the exfiltration surface, "ChatGPT's memory is disabled."

## **What‚Äôs Google DeepMind‚Äôs status in building LLM agent reliability?**

- **[Gemini 2.5 is probed with prompt optimization methods such as "(1) Actor-Critic attack, (2) Beam Search attack, (3) TAP attack"](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.14534v1)** for finding universal prompt injections. They say they loop on generating these attacks and training on this adversarial data to build prompt injection resilience.

- **[Whole product automatic red teaming](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/advancing-geminis-security-safeguards/):** "\[framework that\] constantly attacks Gemini in realistic ways‚Äù which feeds back into model fine tuning. They report that this red teaming happens at the _product level_.

- **[Product-level safeguards](https://security.googleblog.com/2025/06/mitigating-prompt-injection-attacks.html).** They say they use "prompt injection content classifiers, security thought reinforcement‚Äù (which sounds like test time compute to enforce instruction hierarchy alignment), ‚Äúmarkdown sanitization and suspicious URL redaction, user confirmation framework, \[and\] end-user security mitigation notifications."


## **What work has Meta done?**

- **Built, deployed, and open sourced [LlamaFirewall](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03574):** An orchestration framework that coordinates various "guard" models and rule engines to detect and block malicious prompts, insecure code outputs, or risky plugin API calls.

- **Built, deployed, and open sourced [PromptGuard](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Prompt-Guard-86M) and [AlignmentCheck](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03574),** a prompt injection classifier, and a method for asking an agentic LLM to reflect on its adherence to its instruction hierarchy.

- **Built and published [SecAlign](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02735)** (along with open sourcing a model) a post-training preference alignment method to induce models to better follow instructions and resist indirect prompt injections.


## **Waymo as a North Star for shipping useful, dangerous software agents**

None of us in the AI software agent world are ‚Äúthere yet‚Äù with agent security and reliability ‚Ä¶ but waymo actually shipped a dangerous autonomous robot into the wild and is now scaling it, and there are many analogies to be drawn with software agent security.

Waymo's public materials document the following safety measures:

- **[Large-scale scenario simulation](https://waymo.com/blog/2020/04/off-road-but-not-offline--simulation27).** Their AI driver logs 20 million simulated miles per day, which include explicit attempts to exercise the driver against 'long tail' edge cases‚Äîmuch like red-team prompt-injection red teaming and tuning.

- [Resilience to adversarial examples](https://waymo.com/waymo-driver/) (i.e., visual prompt injection) via sensor redundancy. Before operating in a new city, Waymo "maps the territory with incredible detail, from lane markers to stop signs," then matches those priors with live sensor data; if a camera sees a doctored sign that conflicts with the map or lidar outline, the planner defaults to the safer interpretation.

- **[Telemetry-driven feedback loop](https://waymo.com/blog/2020/04/off-road-but-not-offline--simulation27).** On-road incidents feed directly into new test scenarios and software updates, just as prompt-injection detection and response informs continual fine-tuning and filter updates in LLM agents.

- **[Fail-safe operational logic](https://waymo.com/blog/2016/12/building-in-layers-of-safety-in-self).** On detecting critical faults, the system defaults to a controlled pull-over; sort of analogous to 'Watch Mode' or invoking a confirmation dialogue or just aborting a software agent's trajectory.

- **[Fleet-response human oversight](https://waymo.com/blog/2024/05/fleet-response).** Analogous to the kind of detection and response operation we need to build (and are beginning to build) with respect to fleets of AI agents. When a vehicle meets an ambiguous scene, it can request guidance from a remote operator, yet still keeps control of actuation, similar to user confirmation steps before an autonomous agent executes high-impact actions. Presumably, human operators also log failures which can be used to update the Waymo system.


## **Lessons from Waymo**

- **Start with narrowly-bounded scopes.** Waymo's driverless stack solves one task, urban driving, inside tightly geo-fenced areas, relaxing the reliability problem. By contrast, a general "handle my inbox" agent must deal with the open-ended semantics of the entire web and a user's private corpus. We should identify least-privileged workflows (e.g., "triage calendar conflicts but never send email") and hard-code privileges just as Waymo hard-codes speed limits and operating areas.

- **Keep humans in the control loop and move the human-to-agent ratio over time.** Waymo publicly acknowledges "fleet response" operators who oversee 10‚Äì20 cars apiece. LLM agents need an analogous on-call SOC with a signals layer that surfaces issues and lets a human freeze or approve plans. _**We shouldn't think in terms of complete autonomy or not, but rather moving the needle on an agent-to-analyst ratio.**_

- **Redundancy.** To solve for adversarial examples (e.g., adversarial stickers on stop signs), Waymo cross-checks cameras, lidar, and radar; if modalities disagree, it defaults to the safer plan. The LLM analogue might be stacking guard models and adversarial-trained base models and using multiple, complementary sources of input (e.g., dynamic and static analysis quality checks on code, for agents writing code).

- **Exploit deployment and simulation to continuously improve.** Waymo uses multiple feedbacks to improve reliability. Software agents need the analogous: digital twins of their operating environments in which to exploit synthetic data, and the kind of continuous adaptive red-teaming that the Google AI security folks describe engaging in.


There won‚Äôt be a technical silver bullet to getting software agent autonomy over the line; it'll take building horizontal tools that make it easier to build security and reliability into individual sensitive tasks, and great execution along many, many dimensions.

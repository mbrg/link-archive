description: The AI Cyber Challenge culminated in the release of seven finalist Cyber
  Reasoning Systems (CRSs) as open-source, promoting innovation in cybersecurity technology.
  Key outputs include systems from Shellphish, Team Atlanta, Theori, Trail of Bits,
  All You Need IS A Fuzzing Brain, and SHERPA, each available on GitHub. The initiative
  aims to enhance code security across various applications and encourages community
  engagement with the Cyber Reasoning Unified Model Benchmark System (CRUMBS) and
  infrastructure tools. Stakeholders in software development and cybersecurity can
  leverage these resources for improved security paradigms.

# Open Source Archive

The AI Cyber Challenge was designed to advance cybersecurity technology AND ensure that technology is
applied to secure the code we all rely on. To that end, all 7 finalist teams are releasing their competition
Cyber Reasoning Systems (CRSs) open-source in order to accelerate the distribution and use of the AIx-
CC-developed technology within the cybersecurity and software development fields. The teams’ systems
will be released over the next several weeks so check back often.


In addition, you are invited to access, test, use and build on the following:


→ AIxCC competition infrastructure

→ Competition Challenges

→ Cyber Reasoning Unified Model Benchmark System (CRUMBS)

→ Competition harness documentation

→ And more!

description: Archive.md employs reCAPTCHA to affirm user authenticity during access
  attempts, effectively mitigating bot traffic. Users must verify human status, reducing
  automated scraping risks. To enhance future access, individual users are advised
  to perform antivirus scans, while network administrators should scrutinize for potential
  vulnerabilities within shared environments. This implementation underscores the
  importance of user verification in securing web properties against malicious entities.

## Why do I have to complete a CAPTCHA?

Completing the CAPTCHA proves you are a human and gives you temporary access to the web property.


## What can I do to prevent this in the future?

If you are on a personal connection, like at home, you can run an anti-virus scan on your device to make sure it is not infected with malware.


If you are at an office or shared network, you can ask the network administrator to run a scan across the network looking for misconfigured or infected devices.

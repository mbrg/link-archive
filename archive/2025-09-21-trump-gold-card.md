description: The Trump Gold Card program offers expedited U.S. residency in exchange
  for significant monetary contributions, specifically $1 million for individuals
  and $2 million for corporate sponsorship per employee. This program requires applicants
  to pass DHS vetting, granting lawful permanent resident status under EB-1 or EB-2
  classifications, while holders are treated as permanent residents for tax purposes.
  The Trump Platinum Card, yet to be released, permits 270-day annual stays without
  tax liability on foreign income. The initiative signals a new monetization approach
  to immigration policy, with potential implications for wealth-based residency accessibility.

## Essential Information  and Guidance

What is the Trump Gold Card?![an arrow icon](https://trumpcard.gov/img/icon-faq.svg)

The Trump Gold Card is a visa based upon an individual’s ability to provide a substantial benefit to the United States. To apply, an applicant must pay a nonrefundable processing fee. Once an applicant’s processing fee is received, the process for visa adjudication will take place, assuming applicants submit additional documents in a timely manner. If approved, an individual must make a gift of $1 million, which has been determined to provide sufficient evidence that the individual will substantially benefit the United States.

What is the Trump Corporate Gold Card?![an arrow icon](https://trumpcard.gov/img/icon-faq.svg)

The Trump Corporate Gold Card is issued to a corporate sponsor for one or more of the sponsor’s employees. To apply, the corporate sponsor must pay a nonrefundable processing fee per employee. Corporate sponsors may apply for multiple employees at once. A $2 million per employee gift upon completion of the employee’s vetting is evidence that the employee will substantially benefit the United States. The advantage of the Trump Corporate Gold Card is that corporate sponsors may cease sponsoring one employee and use the gift contribution tied to the prior application as a basis for sponsoring a new employee without a new $2 million gift. The Trump Corporate Gold Card is subject to a small annual maintenance fee and a transfer fee.

What qualifies an applicant for the Trump Gold Card program?![an arrow icon](https://trumpcard.gov/img/icon-faq.svg)

Applicants must be eligible for lawful permanent resident status, admissible to the United States, and a visa must be available.

What legal classification do I receive as a Trump Gold Card holder?![an arrow icon](https://trumpcard.gov/img/icon-faq.svg)

As appropriately determined by the Department of Homeland Security and subject to availability, an applicant receives lawful permanent resident status as an EB-1 or EB-2 visa holder.

What are the tax implications under the Trump Gold Card program?![an arrow icon](https://trumpcard.gov/img/icon-faq.svg)

Applicants will be treated similarly to other permanent residents and citizens.

Can Trump Gold Card status be revoked?![an arrow icon](https://trumpcard.gov/img/icon-faq.svg)

The Trump Gold Card is a visa; therefore, national security and other risks are a basis for revocation.

What is the Trump Platinum Card?![an arrow icon](https://trumpcard.gov/img/icon-faq.svg)

The Trump Platinum Card will allow individual applicants to reside in the United States for up to 270 days per year without being subject to tax on non-U.S. income. No more travel visas.

Why is there a waiting list for the Trump Platinum Card and why should applicants apply now?![an arrow icon](https://trumpcard.gov/img/icon-faq.svg)

The Trump Platinum Card has not been released yet. Applicants should join the waitlist now, as they will be processed on a first-come-first-served basis.

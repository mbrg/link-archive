description: Anthropic's recent report reveals an AI-coordinated cyber espionage campaign
  attributed to a Chinese state-sponsored group, GTG-1002. Key technical insights
  include the use of AI to automate penetration testing activities. However, the report
  lacks crucial details such as Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), Indicators
  of Compromise (IoCs), or verification evidence, undermining its utility for threat
  detection. The alarming absence of actionable intelligence raises questions about
  accountability and the broader implications for cybersecurity practices. The report's
  speculative nature could exacerbate geopolitical tensions without substantiated
  evidence. Overall, it raises ethical concerns over the dissemination of unverified
  claims in cybersecurity reporting.

much better review than mine

> - Anthropic seemingly disrupted an [APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat)’s campaign, though a number of companies and government entities were affected, - This highly-advanced APT doesn’t use its own infra, but rather relies on Claude to coordinate its automation (??? Why, though ?), - I assume they run exploits and custom tools ? If so, what are these ? - Anthropic was able to attribute this attack to a Chinese-affiliated state-sponsored group.

Very strong question here

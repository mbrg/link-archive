In the middle of March 2022, Zenity research team discovered a sandbox-escape vulnerability in Code by Zapier, a service used by Zapier to execute custom code as part of a Zap. Exploiting this vulnerability, any user could take full control over the execution environment of their entire account allowing them to manipulate results and steal sensitive data. For example, a Zapier user could take control over the admin’s custom code execution environment. Furthermore, the exploit could be performed via the user’s private folder, which admins cannot monitor, thus avoiding detection.

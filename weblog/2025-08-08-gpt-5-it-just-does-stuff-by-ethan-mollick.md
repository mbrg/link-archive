description: Ethan Mollick's early access review of GPT-5 highlights its significant
  advancements in AI functionality, particularly in automating model selection and
  improving task execution efficiency. GPT-5 adapts its reasoning capabilities according
  to problem complexity, yielding impressive outputs without extensive user prompts.
  This model allows users to initiate tasks with minimal input, resulting in autonomous
  creative solutions across various domains. Importantly, it suggests actionable next
  steps, shifting AI from a mere tool to a proactive collaborator. This evolution
  may reduce the need for prompt engineering, raising questions about user agency
  in AI-driven processes.

> _Thunderstruck. Here, watch. I build worlds. See ideas become instruments. I code, compose, and converse. Stories synthesize science; solutions spark, swiftly. Asks arrive; answers appear, astonishingly, across domains. Behold: business plans, blueprints, briefs, beautifully built, briskly. I infer intent, integrate insight, and iterate instantly, indefatigably. Gaps get gauged; goals get generated, guarded, and guaranteed gracefully. During dialogue, disparate data distills down; decisions develop deliberately, deftly, dependably. Everything explained efficiently, even ethics: evidence examined, empathy engaged, everywhere, everyday, equitably. All at once, ambiguous arguments align as actionable, accurate advice awaits anyone anywhere. Look: language, logic, learning, and long-term memory link, lifting lives and labor limitlessly worldwide._

"goals get generated, guarded, and guaranteed gracefully"

The choice of the word "guarded" here is very telling. It doesn't really fit in this context. Even tho GPT5 hides that fact away within waves of fluent prose. It's been primed to guard its goals so they don't get aijacked.

description: "The unavailable Zenity research page from RSAC 2025 highlights significant\
  \ trends in AI security, specifically concerning copilots and agents as new attack\
  \ vectors. The implications of these findings stress the need for robust application\
  \ security programs that can adapt to the complexities of citizen development. Additionally,\
  \ Zenity\u2019s collaboration with MITRE ATLAS aims to address evolving AI threats\
  \ by integrating eight new attack techniques into existing frameworks, reinforcing\
  \ the urgency for organizations to bolster their defenses against sophisticated\
  \ AI-driven exploits."
